      * Place the space station in the center of the table and load it with
        tiles.
          * Each section of the station should be loaded with 2 stacks of
            12 tiles each.
          * All tiles in a stack should be the same shape and have the same
            orientation.
          * Tiles should be organized into an interior ring (small tiles)
            and an exterior ring (large tiles).
              * Move the interior ring before you start the game to create
                a variable setup.
      * Give each player:
          * 1 planet board
          * 1 corruption board
          * 2 matching depot indicators
          * 5 resource trackers (1 of each color)
      * Each player should take and position the lifepods and rovers as
        instructed on their planet and corporation boards.
      * Each player should position their depot indicator around the space
        station, separated equally, and in front of a depot.
      * Randomly select civ cards such that each rank (1-4) stack contains
        a number of cards equal to player count + 1.
          * The rest of the civ cards can be returned to the box.
      * Create a supply of meteorites and biomass patches.
      * Shuffle and deal the objective cards.  Use the card side and setup
        based on the table below.
      * Choose a start player and give them the station commander token.
