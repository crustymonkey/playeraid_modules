          The game is played in a continuous fashion until a player places
          their 6th star on the board, which will **immediately** end the
          game. Proceed to [final scoring](#scoring).

          Each turn consist of placing your action pawn on 1 of the 4 sections
          of your player mat and taking either the top action, bottom action,
          or both.

          * If both actions are taken, the top action must be taken 1st.
          * The section of the mat you choose **must** be different than the
            selection from your previous turn (you can choose anything for
            your 1st turn).
          * The [costs]!red! and [benefits]!green! are shown as empty boxes
            on your player mat.
          * To take an action, 1st pay the [cost]!red! and take as much of the
            [benefit]!green! as you'd like.
          * After a turn is completed, the next player in clockwise order takes
            their turn.

                    Choose 1:

                    * Move up to 2 **different** units you control 1 space
                      **OR**
                    * Gain 1 coin.

                    Important notes:

                    * Units may pick up/drop off any number of resources
                      during a move action.
                    * Mechs can also carry any number of workers in addition
                      to resource tokens.
                        * You can "chain" actions in this manner. e.g. A mech
                          could pick up a worker, move 1 space and drop off
                          the worker, and then that worker could move 1 more
                          space.
                    * Rivers and lakes cannot be crossed by default. Some mech
                      abilities allow you to break this rule.
                        * A river is a body of water on the border between 2
                          land hexes.
                        * A lake takes up almost the entirety of the hex.
                    * All territories with a tunnel are considered adjacent.
                    * If your character and/or mech move into a territory:
                        * *Only controlled by opponent's workers*: Their
                          movement ends and they cannot be moved again.
                            * All of the opponent workers are moved back to
                              their home base immediately. This could allow
                              another unit to be moved through this territory
                              on the same turn.
                            * You lose 1 popularity for each worker moved.
                            * **Your workers alone cannot move into a territory
                              controlled by opponent workers**.
                        * *Controlled by a structure*: The player who controls
                          the unit now controls the territory.
                        * *Controlled by characters/mechs*: Their movement
                          ends and they cannot move again this turn.
                            * Start a [combat](#combat) in this territory.
                            * **Your workers alone cannot move into a territory
                              controlled by opponent characters/mechs**.
                    * No units can ever voluntarily be moved onto a home base,
                      including your own.
                    * If you move your character onto an encounter space, their
                      movement ends and they cannot be moved again this turn.
                        * After resolving combats, discard the encounter token
                          and resolve the encounter.
                    * There is **no limit** to the number of units on a
                      territory from the same faction.

                        control **with a worker on it**.
                          * You may **not** take this action if all your workers

                      2. Choose a number of **different** territories up to the
                         number of exposed [green boxes]!green! on the action
                         and produce on those territories.
                          * See the [territories](#territories) section for what
                            each type produces.
                      3. On the selected territories, produce 1 resource per
                         worker on the territory.
                          * If you are producing on a village, the new worker
                            is placed from the left-most spot on your player
                            mat.
                          * There are **no limits** to the number of

                * These actions can be taken even if some of the actions can
                  no longer be taken.  e.g. the Upgrade action with nothing
                  more to upgrade.
                * If recruits (cylinders) have been enlisted (removed), you
                  will also gain those benefits for the bottom row action
                  when you or your neighbors take it. See the [enlist](#enlist)
                  action for more info.
                * Players **must** announce their bottom row actions as it may
                  trigger bonuses for other players due to their removed

                        control even if there are no units there. If an
                        opponent has any units there, they control the

                      * Immediately gain the covered bonus on your faction
                        mat.

                          * Gain 2 power
                          * Gain 2 coins
                          * Gain 2 popularity
                          * Draw 2 combat cards
                      * The uncovered space on your player mat reveals an
                        ongoing bonus.
                          * For the rest of the game, when **you or the player

                              * This is done because a 6th star could be
                                placed due to this bonus, which means that
                                subsequent players would **not** receive
                                the bonus.

                Combat occurs at the end of a [move action](#move), but
                **before** the player takes their bottom row action. This
                occurs when the active player's mechs/character share a
                space with an opponents mechs/character.

                * It's possible for combat to occur on multiple territories.
                  In this case, the active player chooses the order of
                  resolution.
                * Whoever wins the combat will gain a star.
                * Other players may try to influence the combat by bribing
                  them with coins.
                * If the attacking player has a mech ability that affects
                  combat, they use that ability 1st.
                * If combat results in a tie, the **attacking** player wins.

                ## Combat Phases

                1. Players simultaneously select the power they want to spend.
                    * You cannot choose more power than you currently have.
                    * You cannot spend more than 7 power in a combat.
                2. (optional) Secretly add combat card(s).
                    * You can add 1 card for each of your character/mechs
                      in the battle.
                    * You do not have to reveal the number of combat cards
                      played (0+).
                3. Both players reveal their power dials and combat cards
                   simultaneously.
                4. The player with highest total power wins, with ties going to
                   the attacker.
                    * *Both players* spend the power they bid.
                    * *Both players* discard all used combat cards.
                    * *The winner* gains or maintains control of the territory.
                    * *The winner* places 1 star on 1 of the 2 combat spaces of
                      the triumph track (if both haven't been filled already).
                    * If *the winner* was the attacker, they lose 1 popularity
                      for each worker they've forced back to their home base.
                    * If there's an encounter token on the space, *the winner*

                  **1** mech may move across a river.
                    * A mech can transport workers.
                    * The character/mech cannot move across multiple rivers
                      when using a move action on a factory card.
                * **Suiton**: Your character/mechs can move to/from lakes.

                * **Ronin**: Before combat where you have exactly 1 unit

                  with a Trap token.
                    * If your character/mech ends their movement on a space
                      with a disarmed trap token, you can arm the trap.
                        * If the movement initiates combat, the trap can
                          only be armed if you win.

          Below are the changes to apply when playing with more than 5 players,
          aka with the expansion(s).

          * **Crimea**: Cover the Wayfare ability with the token from the
            *Invaders from Afar* expansion.  This becomes:
              * Move to any unoccupied farm.
          * **Polania**: Cover the Meander ability with the token from the
            *Invaders from Afar* expansion.  This becomes:
              * Pick up to 2 options per encounter card. At the end, gain $3
                for each encounter territory you control.
          * When determining a 1st player (based on the numbers on the player
            mats), the order is: 1, 2, 2a, 3, 3a, 4, 5.

          Most of the following rules pertain to the airships.

          * Airships **never** control territories.
              * They can fly into any territory, even those controlled by
                opponents.
              * If there are resources and **only** an airship on a
                territory, you cannot spend those resources (you don't control
                the territory).
              * For end game scoring, if there is **only** an airship on a
                territory, you do not count it as a controlled territory.
          * Airships transporting resources:
              * Airships cannot pick up resources on territories controlled
                by opponents.
              * Resources on an airship remain under your control until they
                are spent or dropped off.
              * Resources on an airship count during end game scoring.
          * Airships transporting workers:
              * A worker on an airship does **not** give you control of a
                territory.
              * The workers on an airship cannot produce or trade on that
                territory.
              * Opponents cannot interact with workers on an airship.
              * Workers can only be dropped off on territories void of
                opponents.
              * An airship must drop off a worker during its move action.
                  * A worker cannot move directly from an airship to another
                    territory.
              * A worker picked up by an airship cannot transport resources
                onto the airship.
          * Airship movement:
              * The airship can only be moved as part of a standard move
                action, like any other unit.
              * The range is indicated in the hex on the upper right part of
                the [passive airship tile]!green!.
              * Airships are not constrained by rivers or lakes.
              * Airships can freely move in and out of any territory, including
                those controlled by opponents.
              * Any number of airships can be on a territory.
              * If using the move ability from a factory card, the airship's
                movement is increased by +1.
              * Airships do **not** benefit from mech abilities.
              * Airships may not move onto home bases.
              * Airships may **not** move through tunnels/mines.
          * Airships are not considered to be "occupying" a territory by
            itself. There must be at least 1 unit **on the territory** to be
            "occupied".
          * Having an airship on a territory does **not** increase the number
            of combat cards that can be played.
          * Airships do not trigger traps.
          * **Blitzkrieg**: This [aggressive ability]!red! allows combat to
            happen between airships.
              * The winner gains a star.
              * It is the only time an airship can retreat. Other units on
                the territory do not engage or retreat.

                This changes the way a game of Scythe ends. If playing with
                this module, ignore the standard end-game trigger.

                * Some resolution tiles allow you to place stars on the tiles,
                  objective cards, etc.  These are counted for end game
                  scoring.
                    * You can never place more than 6 stars.
                    * It will be possible now for multiple players to place
                      6 stars.
                * You may not take any action more than once per turn.
