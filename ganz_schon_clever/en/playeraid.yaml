          * Each player takes a pen and score sheet
          * Randomly choose a start player, who gets the 6 dice
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
          The game is played over 4 (4 players), 5 (3 players), or 6
          (1 and 2 player) rounds.  At the start of the first 4 rounds,
          each player gets 1 bonus, as shown on the round tracker on the
          score sheet (players choose 1 of the 2 options in round 4).
      sections:
          - name: Active Player
            text: |
                1. The active player rolls all 6 dice at once, then chooses 1,
                   placing it on of their 3 dice fields (top left of score
                   sheet), without changing the number of the die.
                2. Using the chosen die, the player must now use the value and
                   the color to mark on his sheet a corresponding number in the
                   same color field.  The white die a wild color and can be
                   used in place of any other color.
                3. The active player puts **all dice that show a lower value**
                   than the currently selected die on the silver tray printed
                   in the box.  If a player picks the lowest value, no dice
                   are placed on the silver tray.  Dice on the silver tray
                   can no longer be used by the active player (*exception:
                   Additional Dice action*)
                4. With the remaining dice, the active player rolls a 2nd time.
                   They again choose a die, place in on a free dice field, and
                   enters its value in the matching color field on their game
                   sheet.  All dice that show a lower value than the selected
                   die again are placed on the silver platter.
                5. The active player then rolls a 3rd time and executes the
                   actions as described above 1 last time.  Then they place
                   **all remaining dice** not on their score sheet on the
                   silver platter.

                **Attention**:  If a player decides in the 1st or 2nd roll to
                take high dice, it may happen that there are no dice left for
                a reroll.  If this happens, the player simply performs fewer
                than 3 rolls.
          - name: Passive Players
            text: |
                Only after the active player has placed 3 dice on their game
                board or can no longer reroll because all remaining dice are on
                the silver platter do the other players get a turn.

                * All passive players now get the dice set aside on the silver
                  platter.
                      * Of these dice, each player can choose 1 die to use
                        to mark a space on their score sheet.
                      * All passive players choose simultaneously, and a die
                        can be chosen by multiple passive players.
                      * After each passive player has marked their chosen die,
                        the player to the left becomes the active player.  They
                        get all 6 dice and rolls and rerolls, as described
                        above.
          - name: Special Cases
            text: |
                * If a passive player can't use any die from the silver platter,
                  they may use one die from the active player's pad.  It is not
                  possible to voluntarily refuse a die from the silver platter
                  to do this.

                * If the active player can't use any of the dice from a given
                  roll, they simply cannot put a die on their sheet for that
                  roll. This still takes one of their maximum of 3 rolls
    - name: The Score Sheet
      text: |
          * The score sheet has 5 colored areas.  For each die, a player will
            mark 1 field or write 1 number in 1 space.
          * 3 areas (green, orange, and purple) show an arrow on the left.
            You will start entering numbers at the left of these lines and
            proceed right, in order without skipping spaces.
          * In the 2 areas without numbers (yellow and blue), you can enter an
            appropriate number no matter where it is.  The white die is wild
            and can either be used as a yellow, green, orange, or purple die or
            can be combined with the blue die to create a sum for the blue area.
      sections:
          - name: The Yellow Area
            text: |
                You simply cross out the value of the chosen die in this area.
                Although each value appears twice, you may only cross out 1
                block per chosen die.  Spaces can be marked off in any order.
                Once a column is filled, the player circles the starred number
                at the bottom of the column.  **These spaces can be completed
                in any order**.
          - name: The Blue Area
            text: |
                If a player chooses a blue die, they add the current value of
                the white die to it to determine the combined value (no matter
                where the white die is).  The same applies in reverse.  If the
                player uses the white die as a wild blue, they add the current
                value of the blue die to the white die to come up with a total.
                If the active player chooses the blue die on 1 turn and the
                white die on another turn, they could potentially mark 2 blue
                fields on the same turn.  **These spaces can be completed
                in any order**.

                At the end of the game, players count how many marks they have
                made in the blue area.  The point scale at the top of the area
                indicates how many points they get for the section.
          - name: The Green Area
            text: |
                Players must start at the leftmost space and proceed to the
                right, not skipping any spaces.  For each space, players must
                meet the minimum required value in order to be eligible to mark
                the next space.

                The white number in the star above the last selected field
                indicates the number of points scored for this section at
                the end of the game.
          - name: The Orange Area
            text: |
                Players must start at the leftmost space and proceed to the
                right, not skipping any spaces.  There are no restrictions
                here, but some spaces have multipliers.  Here, the player
                multiplies the die value times the multiplier and records
                **that** number.

                At the end of the game, players score the sum of all recorded
                number from the orange row.
          - name: The Purple Area
            text: |
                Players must start at the leftmost space and proceed to the
                right, not skipping any spaces.  For each space, the number
                entered must be higher than the previous number.  There is an
                exception!  After a player enters a 6, any number may come next.

                At the end of the game, players score the sum of all recorded
                number from the purple row.
          - name: The Bonuses
            text: |
                Players can earn bonuses, which are listed at the end of
                the rows or columns, or directly below certain fields.

                * X-bonus: As soon as a player completes a row, column, or
                  fields with an X-bonus, they must **immediately** mark a
                  box in the corresponding color area.  This can be any number
                  in the yellow or blue area and will always be the next field
                  in the green area.
                * A purple or orange background with a number indicates that a
                  player can immediately place this number in their next
                  available space in the corresponding area.  This must be done
                  **immediately** and can't be saved for later.
                * If entering a bonus awards another bonus, it is executed
                  immediately.  Players can chain bonuses.
                * Bonus on an individual field -> Redeemed immediately as a
                  number is entered in this field.
                * Bonus at the end of a line or column -> Redeemed only once
                  all fields in the line/column are marked.
                * Foxes: Foxes award points at the end of the game.  Each
                  activated fox will score as many points as the
                  lowest-scoring colored area.
          - name: The Actions
            text: |
                The 2 action bars can be unlocked during the game.  Unlike
                bonuses, actions can either be used immediately after
                they've been unlocked or can be saved for a later turn.

                When a player unlocks an action, they should circle the next
                space in the corresponding row.  After they use the action,
                they should cross out the 1st available circled space.
                Players can perform as many actions as they wish on a given
                turn.

                * Reroll action: This can be used only by the active player.
                  If they wish to reroll all of the dice they just rolled,
                  they can spend an action to do so.  **All rolled dice must
                  be rerolled when doing this**.
                * Extra die action: Using this action, an extra die can be
                  selected.  This action can only be performed at the end of
                  a turn.  This is after either the active player has regularly
                  assigned a die to one of their die fields or after a passive
                  player has chosen a die from the silver platter.
                    * With this action, the player can choose any of the 6
                      dice, including a die that the active player has taken
                      or even the die that the player just took with their
                      regular action.
                    * Players can use multiple additional die actions during
                      a single turn, but each individual die can only be
                      chosen once in a turn.
    - name: Game End
      text: |
          The game ends after the last active player has finished their
          last turn in the last round and after the passive players have
          all taken their actions for this turn.

          A player will then record the scores for each player in each
          colored area.  Earned foxes will be scored for each player.  A
          player's foxes are each worth that player's lowest scoring area.

          Points are summed, and the player with the highest total wins.
          If there is a tie, the player with the highest score in an
          individual area breaks the tie.  If no winner can still be
          determined, the victory is shared.
