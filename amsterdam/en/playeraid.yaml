      * Place the main game board, the resource board, and the game round
        board on the table.
      * Put all the commodity tiles in the bag, then draw them randomly and
        place 1 face up on each building "block".
      * Put the 12 dock workers in the bag, then randomly put 2 on each of
        the docks (where there is a crane) with the following restrictions:
          * The 2 dock workers must be different.
          * Neither dock worker can match the dock's color.
      * Sort all cards by the color of their backs, then shuffle each deck
        and place them on their spaces on the game round board.
      * Separately shuffle the 16 market tiles in their "A" and "B" stacks.
        Then place the "B" stack on its space on the game round board, and
        finally place the "A" stack on top of it.
      * Put the game round tracker on the 1st space of the round track.
      * Sort the resources by colorand form a supply on the houses of
        the same color on the resource board.
          * Note that there are 2 different sizes of cubes, with the larger
            cubes equaling 5 of the small cubes.
      * Place the coins in a supply on the resource board.
      * Create a supply of action markers on the resource board.
      * Create a supply of penalty tokens on the resource board.
      * Create a supply of the "x5" multiplier tokens.
      * Each player takes, in their color:
          * 1 "100/200" point tile
          * 1 player board
          * 2 summary cards
          * 1 rondel board
          * 1 row boat -- place it on the 0 space of the scoring track
          * 1 barge -- place it on the start pier of the matching color in the
            harbor
          * 15 control crests -- place them on the residential house on your
            player board
          * 1 disc
          * 1 money
      * Set all the dice near the board.
      * Randomly choose a start player and place each player's disc in
        a stack in clockwise order from the start player to the last player.
        The stack will have the 1st player's disc on top and the last player's
        on the bottom. Place the stack on the start space of the canal.
      * Draw a number of craftsmen and building cards based on the player
        count (see the table below) and place them face up near the board.
          * In reverse player order, starting with the player whose disc is at
            the bottom of the discs on the canal track, each player takes
            1 card and places it in a slot on their player board.
          * All remaining cards are discarded.
      * In turn order (start with the top of the canal stack), each player
        takes 1 resource of their choice and places it in the 1 spot of their
        rondel.
      * Repeat the previous, but this time each player takes 2 resources and
        places them in their 2 slot.

      The game is played over 12 rounds, with each round consisting of 4
      phases.  The player with the most points at the end of the game will win.

      * Note that activated cards with a phase designation (I/II/III) can be
        used in their matching phases.
          * Phase cards (I/II/III) **can only be used once per round**.
            Place an action marker on the card when used.
          * Cards marked with a ∞ symbol are permanent abilities that can
            be used as triggered.
          * Cards with a laurel are for end game scoring.
      * Player order is always determined by the current order of discs on
        the canal track. If 2+ discs are on the same space, the disc on top
        is 1st and the disc on the bottom is last (in context of the stack).
      * Players may look at the cards in the discard at any time.
      * None of the resources, except cards, are limited.  Use multiplier
        tokens when needed.

      - name: "Phase I: Reveal and Select Cards"
        text: |
          * Reveal a number of cards based on the table below.
          * In player order (canal discs), each player selects one of the
            revealed cards and places it in a slot at the bottom of their
            board.
              * If all 5 of a player's slots are filled when they take a
                new card, they must discard 1 of the 6 cards, and then
                **take a penalty token**.
          * Place all remaining cards in the discard.

      - name: "Phase II: Roll Dice and Take Resources"
        text: |
          1. The 1st player rolls all 6 of the dice and places them in their
             matching spaces on the resource board (below the resources).
              * **In rounds 8-12**, some die values are changed to 1s.  See
                the round track for which die values are changed.
          2. Simultaneously (or in player order), each player chooses 2 dice
             to gain matching resources.
              * For each chosen die, take a number of resources matching the
                number on the die, then place these in the slot on your
                rondel matching the die.  e.g. If you select an orange "2" die
                as 1 of your dice, you would take 2 orange resources and place
                them in the "2" slot of your rondel.
          3. All players rotate their rondel 1 slot **counter-clockwise**.
              * Any resources on the arrow space are added to your supply on
                your player board along with a (possible) saved resource
                from the previous round.
              * **If no resources end up in the arrow space, you must take
                1 penalty token**.
      - name: "Phase III: Perform Actions"
        text: |
          * **Important**: Only 1 resource can be saved at the end of the
            round (on your house on your player board). All other resources
            will be discarded at the end of the round.
          * In player order, players can take any/all of the actions in
            any combination or sequence.

              * In order to use the powers on your cards, they must 1st be
                activated.
              * To activate a card, pay the resource cost shown at the bottom
                of the art, then move the card from its slot at the bottom
                of your board to above the board.
                  * The number of cards above your board is unlimited.

                        can store on your player board.
                  * **Instead of adding the commodity to your board**,
                    you may immediately place it on a matching space in the
                    black market. Note that there is only room for 1 of each
                    commodity in the black market. Then gain:
                      * Any 1 resource from the supply **OR**
                      * Take 2 money from the supply
                  * Players can buy buildings anywhere on the board. While
                    adjacency will get you more points at the [end of the

                resource per space.
              * You may move as many times and as far as you'd like on your
                turn (paying the cost to do so).

                    numbered spot on orange building on the lower right
                    portion of the main board.
                      * The higher value spaces can only hold 1 dock worker,
                        but the larger bottom space can hold any number of
                        dock workers.
              * At a storehouse location (⚓ icon):
                  * You may drop off a **matching** commodity (spaces with
                    a "?" can take any commodity) and place it on the highest
                    numbered space on the adjacent building. Gain the points
                    immediately.
                      * Note that there is only 1 space for a commodity

              * You can move your disc as many spaces as you would like by
                paying 1 resource for the 1st space, and 2 resources for
                each space after that. e.g. To move 3 spaces, you would spend
                5 resources.
                  * If you end your movement on an occupied space, put your
                    disc on top.
                  * If you cross a bridge, gain the points shown on it.
              * If you arrive at the end of the canal, place your disc on the

    text: |
      After the 12 round, the following occurs.

      * **Players gain 1 penalty token for each card still below their board**
        (un-activated).

      ## Scoring
      * Players lose points for penalty tokens based on the table below.
      * Each player scores points for their end game scoring cards (laurel).
      * Each player scores points for their largest number of connected
        buildings:
          * Number of buildings x 3
      * Evaluate the district tiles for regional majorities and award points
        based on the table below.
          * If there is a tie, add the points for the tied positions, then
            divide them equally between players, rounding down.
      * Each player scores points for leftovers:
          * (Commodities + dock workers + money + resources) / 2 (round down)

      The player with the most points wins. If tied, the player further
      ahead on the canal track wins.
