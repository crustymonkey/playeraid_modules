              Each player places their 3 Targi figures on the edge cards.
              At the 2 intersections, they place their Tribal markers.
              The cards where your Targi and Tribal markers stand indicate
              the available actions.

              The game ends when 1 of the players has played 12 Tribal cards,
              or when the robber has made 1 round of the edge cards.

              text: |
                  * Starting with the start player, each player alternates
                    placing 1 of their Targi figures until all 3 are placed.
                  * **No figures may be placed on the following spaces**:
                      * On the space with the Robber

                      * On a space with another player's Targi
                      * On a space opposite an opponent's Targi
            - name: 3. Place the Tribal marker on the crossing points
              text: |
                  * Each player places their 2 Tribal markers at the
                    intersection(s) of their Targi figures.
            - name: 4. Executing Actions
              text: |
                  * Beginning with the start player, each player plays all
                    the actions from their Targi and Tribal marker.  
                  * They get to decide the order of execution
                  * **An action must be completed before executing the
                    next action**.
                  * Once an action has been taken on a space, the player
                    removes their Targi/Tribal marker from the card.
                  * If a center space is used, the card is immediately
                    replaced with a card of the opposite type.  e.g. if a
                    Goods card is used, it is replaced by a Tribal card (and
                    vice versa).
                      * If the Goods draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard
                        pile
                      * Tribal cards are placed in front of the player and
                        the cost is paid. The Tribal card can also be taken
                        into the player's hand instead
                      * **Only 1 Tribal card may be held in hand**.  If
                        a 2nd card would be taken into hand, **it is discarded
                        instead**.
                      * A Tribal card in hand can **only be played in a later
                        round when using the "Noble" space**
                          * The cost is paid at this time
                          * The card may be discarded at this time instead of
                            playing it (to make room for a new card)

              text: |
                  * Turn over all the Goods/Tribal cards in the center of the
                    play area
                  * The start player is given to the other player
                  * The next round begins with the Robber movement

    - name: Game End and Scoring
      text: |

              * At the end of the round when a player has played their 12th
                Tribal card
              * The Robber is moved onto the 4th Raid space.  Players must still
                pay for this Raid, however.
          * Add up all Silver crosses from tokens and Tribal cards
          * Add the points for Tribal card tableau rows:
              * 4 points for completed rows of cards with all matching symbols
              * 2 points for completed rows of cards with 4 different symbols
          * If there is a tie:
              1. The player with the most Gold
              2. The player with the most Goods
              3. The game is a draw
