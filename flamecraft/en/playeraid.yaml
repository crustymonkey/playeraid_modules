          The goal of the game is to have the most reputation (victory points)
          at the end of the game. Play will continue until either the Artisan
          deck or the Enchantment deck runs out. Proceed to
          [game end](#game_end) when this happens.

          On a turn, you have 2 choices: visit a shop and either
          *[gather](#gather)* or *[enchant](#enchant)*.

          **Note**: All goods/coins are considered to be unlimited.

          * 1st, move your player token onto the shop you wish to visit.
              * You **must** move to a new shop.  You cannot stay on the same
                shop for multiple consecutive turns.
              * **If there are other players already there**, you must give
                each of them 1 good of your choice (or 1 coin). If you cannot
                pay the other players, you **cannot** visit that shop.
          * After performing your action, perform the [end your turn](#end_turn)
            steps.

                  * Dragons are added to your hand.
              2. You may place 1 artisan dragon from your hand in an empty
                 dragon slot at your shop and gain the reward.
                  * The dragon's icon in the top left **must** match of the
                    icons on the empty slot where you will place the dragon.
                  * Slots in the shop can be filled in any order.
                  * Gain the printed [reward](#rewards) on the slot for
                    adding a dragon to the shop.
                  * **If you have filled a shop** (all slots have dragons),
                    draw a new shop and place it in an empty town slot **face
                    down** (do not look at the new shop).
              3. You may fire up (use the ability of) **1** dragon in your
                 shop.
                  * This can be a dragon you placed or 1 that was already
                    there.
              4. Some shops have abilities listed in a strip above the dragon
                 slots. You may now use the shop's ability.

              1. Choose an enchantment from the faceup row, or 1 you have
                 [reserved](#other), pay its goods cost and tuck it behind

                  * Shops with a ![artisan](/static/img/flamecraft/artisan.png)

                    be enchanted.
                  * If an enchantment has a 
                    ![no coin](/static/img/flamecraft/no_coin.png) symbol,
                    you **cannot** use coins to pay for the goods on the
                    enchantment.
                  * The enchantment's icon **must** match the shop's icon
                    (upper left).
                  * If a shop has a wild icon, any enchantment can be cast
                  * **A shop cannot have more than 3 enchantments**.
                  * You may use coins in place of any good(s).

                    card.
                      * Some cards have variable rewards depending on how
                        many sets of goods were paid for it.
                  * Tuck the enchantment behind the shop.
                    there.
              2. You may fire up (use the ability of) **all** dragons at
                 the shop.
                  * If firing up a dragon lets you add a dragon to your
                    current shop, you may also fire up that dragon.

                    triggers the [end of the game](#game_end)
    - name: Game End
      id: game_end
      text: |
          When the last card of the Artisan or Enchantment deck is
          drawn/revealed, the game end is triggered. Each player, including
          the player that triggered the game end, gets **1 final turn**.

          your current reputation to calculate your final score.

          | Ability | Clarifications |
          | ------- | -------------- |
          | Gain 2 of 1 good from this shop or an Artisan Dragon | The 2 goods you take **must** be the same. If it is a wild shop, you can take 2 of any 1 good. You cannot use this to gain coins or dragons. If an ability allows you to fire up this dragon in a location other than a shop, you may gain goods from any dragon at that location. |
          | Place an Artisan dragon in town | You may place your dragon in any empty slot in town with the matching icon (including the shop you are visiting). You gain the printed reward in the slot. |
          | Draw 1 Artisan dragon | You may take any faceup dragon from the park or draw the top card from the deck. |
          | Gain any 3 different goods | You may choose any 3 different goods. |
          | Swap this with another Artisan dragon in town and fire up the new dragon | Ignore the icons on the shop slots involved. This does not count as placing a dragon and does not earn the slot reward for either location. |
          | Gift a good to another player to gain 2 reputation | Gift any 1 good from your personal supply to another player of your choice and gain 2 reputation. See Giving Gifts under [Other Rules](#other) for more info. |

          ## Giving Gifts

          Some abilities allow you to gift goods, coins, cards, etc. to other
          players for rewards.

          * Gifts are given from your personal supply/hand.
          * You may use coins in place of specific goods.
          * If you get a reward, other than reputation, take the reward from
            the general supply (not your opponent).

          ## Reserving Enchantments

          Some abilities will let you reserve an enchantment.

          * When enchanting, you can use your reserved enchantment instead of
            using 1 from the face up row.
          * You are limited to **1 reserved enchantment**.
              * If you have an enchantment reserved and would be able reserve
                another, you **cannot do so**.

          ## Fancy Dragons

          There are 2 types of Fancy dragons.

          * **☀ (sun) Dragons**: These dragons are scored during the game when
            their goal has been fulfilled.
              * They can be fulfilled any time during your turn.
              * If you must spend goods, return these to the general supply.
          * **☾ (moon) Dragons**: These are only scored at the game end if
            their goals were fulfilled.

          There is **no limit** to the number of Fancy dragons you can have.

    - name: Companions
      id: companions
      text: |
          Companions are optional, but will provide a 1-time ability during
          the game.

          * Setup: Randomly deal 1 companion to each player. Players place the
            companion face up in front of themselves.
              * If there is a "START" text on the card, the player starts the
                game with that bonus.
          * The abilities can be used **once per game**.
              * When the ability is used, flip the companion over to show it
                has been used.
