    text: |
      Players take turns performing actions on their turn until a player
      reaches the end of the carbon track, which triggers the [end of the
      game](#endgame).

      ## Turns
      1. Perform 1 action. You can only take 1 action per turn.
      2. If you absorbed 1 or more carbon, move up **1** space on the carbon
         track.
      3. If you made any progress on a goal card, mark it with your goal
         counters on the goal card.
      4. Draw back up to 3 mushroom tiles in hand.

      ## Activation Tokens
      * You have 1 activation token per mushroom type.
      * When these are spent, they are flipped from their ready (color) to the
        used side (gray).  Only ready tokens can be used.
      * These tokens are used to pay activation costs and/or absorb carbon.

      ## Carbon Track
      * You only move 1 stone on the track, regardless of how much carbon
        was [absorbed](#absorb) on your turn.
      * Immediately take the benefit from the stone you land on.
          * For bonus tiles, look at all the tiles, take 1, and put the rest
            back face down.
              * Keep your tile face down.  It may be discarded at any time
                for the benefit shown on it.
              * If the tile gives you points, reveal it during scoring at
                the end of the game.
      * When a player moves **past** stone 8, they place their token on 1
        of the 5 round spaces and take the reward.
          * This triggers the [end of the game](#endgame).

      ## Placing Mushrooms
      * This only happens when you take the [reproduce](#reproduce) or
        [partner](#partner) action.
      * The mushroom tile must be placed orthogonally adjacent to at least
        1 other mushroom.
      * Do **not** pay the cost shown on the mushroom (this is an
        [activation](#activate) cost).
      * When placing your seedling and/or root during the
        [reproduce](#reproduce) or [partner](#partner) action, you may place
        them on this new mushroom.
      * You may only place 1 mushroom on your turn (unless an ability allows
        you to do otherwise).
    sections:
      - name: "Action: Activate"
        id: activate
        text: |
          * Activate a mushroom by paying its cost and activating its ability.
              * You **must** have a root on the tile you wish to activate.
              * Costs may include flipping over a ready activation token to
                its used side.
              * Carbon is payed onto the mushroom tile you are activating.
              * Some costs include P/N/K (Phosphorous/Nitrogen/Potassium) that
                is payed to the supply.
          * Mushrooms with "ONGOING" abilities do not need to be activated,
            they just boost other actions.
              * You must have at least 1 root on these mushrooms to use their
                abilities.  Additional roots do not boost the abilities.
      - name: "Action: Absorb"
        id: absorb
        text: |
          * Either flip any ready activation token or pay 1 cube of your
            choice to activate this.
          * Optional:  You may move 1 carbon that you plan to absorb.
              * For **each space** you wish to move a carbon, either flip
                any ready activation token or pay 1 cube of your choice.
              * Carbon movements are **only** orthogonal.
              * You do not need to have a root on the mushroom where you are
                moving the carbon *from*.
              * You must have a root on the tile that you move the carbon *to*.
              * If you have a mushroom power that allows you to absorb 2
                carbon, **you may move 2 different carbon tokens**, paying
                the costs for all of their movements separately.
          * Take 1 carbon off of a mushroom where you have a root and place
            it on your seedling.
              * You cannot pay extra to absorb more than 1 carbon.
              * Some mushroom powers allow you to absorb more than 1 carbon.
              * **If your seedling has 3 carbon on it**, return the 3 carbon
                to the supply and place 1 of your trees on your seedling.
                  * You can only make 4 trees during the game.
                  * If you have all 4 trees out, your seedlings can continue
                    to absorb carbon, even beyond the limit of 3.
                  * You do **not** get that seedling back.

            mushroom tile from your hand into the forest.
          * Place 1 seedling with 1 root on any unclaimed corner in the forest.
              * Once played, seedlings never move.
              * You don't have to place your seedlings near your other
                seedlings.
              * No other player may use that same corner.
              * The root must be touching the seedling you just placed.

              * Each root must be attached to 1 of your seedlings.
                  * Both roots may be attached to the same seedling, but it
                    is not required.
              * You cannot place a root on a corner without a mushroom.
              * You can only place 18 roots during a game.

          This action is used to replenish your carbon and tokens.

          * Take 2 carbon from the supply.
          * You may pay any number of N to the supply to take an equal number
            of additional carbon.
          * Flip all of your used activation tokens to their ready side.
          * Optional: You may discard any number of mushroom tiles from your
            hand. Remember that you will draw back up to 3 mushroom tiles
            at the end of your turn.
  - name: End of the Game
    id: endgame
    text: |
      The end of the game is triggered when any player reaches the top of
      the carbon track. When this happens:

      1. Finish the current round (equal turns).
      2. Play 1 final round.

      ## Scoring
      * [Goal cards](#goals) are scored as indicated on the cards.
      * Score roots:
          * Seedlings with 1 carbon score 1 root.
          * Seedlings with 2 carbon score 2 root.
          * Trees score all their roots.
          * If you have more roots than carbon, you choose which root(s) to
            score.
          * The score of a root is the point value shown at the bottom of the
            mushroom tile.
      * Score any points printed on bonus tiles.
      * Gain 1 point for every 2 unused resources (C/N/P/K).
      * If you claimed 2 points at the end of the carbon track, score that.
  - name: Goal Cards
    id: goals
    text: |
      * All players may score points on all 3 goal cards.
      * Some goals must be tracked during the game because they track when
        do something.  Others track how much of a thing you have at the
        end of the game.
      * Some goals can go above 10.  If this happens, leave your tracking disc
        on 10 and use your extra tracking disc to continue counting.
      * There are 3 different types of scoring tables:
          * Counter tables award points depending on where you are on the
            card's track.
          * Competitive tables award points depending on how you finished
            compared to the other players.
              * If there is a tie, add the point values for the tied places
                together and divide by the number of players, rounded
                down.
          * Multiplier tables award points by multiplying your position on
            the card's track or other variables.

      - name: Glossary
        text: |
          * **1A**: Track how many times you made 6 or more carbon in a
            turn.  You generally have to pay 4 or more N to do this.  You
            can count carbon from bonus tiles or ongoing abilities.
          * **1B**: Each time you Photosynthesize and pay N to gain carbon,
            move your disc up the goal track 1 space for each N paid.
          * **2A**: You want to spread horizontally to have as many
            trees/seedlings as possible on vertical lines.
          * **2B**: Count the number of unique mushrooms your trees/seedlings
            are touching. **Each mushroom only counts once**.
              * You do not need a root on a mushroom for it to count.
          * **3A**: Count the number of trees you've grown.
          * **3B**: Count how many seedlings/trees you have with 2 or more
            roots.
          * **4A**: This tracks how many times you place 2 roots on the
            same *type* (symbol to the left of its name) of mushroom in
            a single turn. They may be on the same mushroom or 2 different
            mushrooms.
          * **4B**: Count how many roots you've placed.
          * **5A and 5B**: These look at the point value of the mushroom
            that each root is on and whether the value is even or odd.
              * A player may count a mushroom with multiple roots more than
                once as **the count is by root**.
              * Mushrooms with variable points are only counted by their
                point value at the end of the game.
          * **6A and 6B**: These goals look at the name of the mushroom that
            each root is on. Mushrooms are marked with stars for names with a
            color and circles for names with a person/animal.
              * A player may count a mushroom with multiple roots more than
                once as **the count is by root**.
          * **7A**: Each root can only count towards 1 set.
              * Mushrooms with variable points are only counted by their
                point value at the end of the game.
          * **7B**: This goal counts how many seedlings/trees you have on
            the 12 corners created as a square with the Earthlover mushroom
            in the middle.
          * **8A**: Move your disc up the track any time you take the absorb
            action or activate a mushroom that allows you to absorb and move
            1 carbon 2 or more spaces.
              * If you move a different carbon 2 or more space in the same
                turn, you move your disc an additional space on the track.
          * **8B**: This goal counts any time you ready all 4 activation
            tokens in a turn by any method.
              * Only used tokens can be readied, so **you must have all 4
                tokens in a used state to ready them all in a single turn**.
