      * Place the space station in the center of the table and load it with
        tiles.
          * Each section of the station should be loaded with 2 stacks of
            12 tiles each.
          * All tiles in a stack should be the same shape and have the same
            orientation.
          * Tiles should be organized into an interior ring (small tiles)
            and an exterior ring (large tiles).
              * Move the interior ring before you start the game to create
                a variable setup.
      * Give each player:
          * 1 planet board
          * 1 corruption board
          * 2 matching depot indicators
          * 5 resource trackers (1 of each color)
      * Each player should take and position the lifepods and rovers as
        instructed on their planet and corporation boards.
      * Each player should position their depot indicator around the space
        station, separated equally, and in front of a depot.
      * **If playing with the [events module](#event)**:
          1. Separate the event deck into 3 piles of cards separated by
             event type (green, orange, red).
          2. Remove any solo mode cards.
          3. Create a deck of 20 cards to be used during the game by
             randomly selecting cards from the different decks. You can
             customize the event difficulty by choosing from the decks of
             your choice.
      * Randomly select civ cards such that each rank (1-4) stack contains
        a number of cards equal to player count + 1.
          * The rest of the civ cards can be returned to the box.
      * Create a supply of meteorites and biomass patches.
      * **If playing with the [private objectives](#private) module**:
          * Deal 2 private objective cards to each player (neighbor side up).
            Each player chooses 1 to keep and returns the other to the box.
      * Shuffle and deal the objective cards.  Use the card side and setup
        based on the table below.
      * Choose a start player and give them the station commander token.

      | Players | Card Side | Objective Setup |
      | ------- | --------- | --------------- |
      | 3-6 players | Neighbor | 1 card between each player |
      | 2 players | Neighbor | 3 cards between both players |
      | solo | Private | 4 cards, choose 3 to play with |
  - name: Gameplay

      The game is played over a number of rounds until either a player cannot
      legally place a tile from their depot or when 1 depot is completely
      emptied.  Either case will trigger [game end](#game_end).

      * Each round:
          1. The station commander **may** rotate the space station as much
             or as little as they like, until they have any 1 depot in front of
             themselves.
          2. (If playing with the [event module](#event)) Immediately draw
             the next event card from the deck and execute its action.
              * All actions **must** be executed, if possible, for all
                events and all players.
          3. All players must draft 1 of the 2 tiles in front of them (or their
             depot indicator).
          4. After players place the tile on their planet according to
             [placement rules](#place), they advance 1 space on each resource
             track matching the resources shown on the placed tile.
              * If a tile with a meteorite symbol is placed, immediately
                cover the square with the symbol with a meteorite token.
              * If a tile with a water resource does not have its **water
                terrain** covering at least 1 ice space, you **cannot
                advance on the water resource track**.
              * If a tile has an energy resource, you advance 1 of the
                following:
                  1. The non-energy resource on the tile you placed.
                  2. The resource of any 1 terrain that is orthogonally
                     adjacent to the energy terrain area from the tile
                     placement.
          5. Pass the station commander token to the next player in clockwise
             order.
    sections:
      - name: Placement Rules
        id: place
        text: |
          * The 1st tile placed on your planet must be touching the outside
            edge of your planet.
          * All tiles must be placed orthogonally adjacent to another tile
            (after the 1st tile).
          * Tiles cannot be placed on top of other tiles.
          * Tiles cannot overlap other tiles or extend off the planet's
            printed grid.
          * Tile must be aligned with the grid squares.
          * If a tile is placed onto a lifepod or rover, the lifepod/rover is
            destroyed and **removed from the game**.
          * If a tile with a water resource is NOT placed on at least 1
            ice space, you cannot advance on the water resource track.
      - name: Resource Tracks
        text: |
          * Medals: You claim the highest medal (point) value you reached at
            the end of the game.
          * Synergy boosts: You claim these immediately -- advance any single
            tracker once.
          * If a tracker reaches the top of its track, it does not gain
            additional benefits. It will score the points indicated at the
            top of the track at the [end of the game](#game_end).
              * The [rovers](#rover) can still move (X spaces) each time they
                would advance, but are at the top of the track.
          * Tracks may have additional benefits.
      - name: Civ Resource Track
        text: |
          * When hitting a civ milestone, take all civ cards of the
            corresponding rank and select 1 to keep. Return the rest to the
            supply.
              * If 2+ players reach the same milestone during the same round,
                cards are selected in clockwise order (starting with the
                commander).
          * After choosing a card, claim any benefits on the card if it's
            labeled *Immediate*.
          * Cards labeled *End Game* are scored at the [end of the
            game](#game_end).
          * If there are no cards left in the civ pile, you cannot claim a
            card.
      - name: Rover Resource Track
        id: rover
        text: |
          * When a player advances onto a rover milestone, they place a
            rover on any space of the last placed tile.
              * If the rover is placed on a meteorite, immediately collect it.
          * When advancing onto a number, move your rover a number of spaces
            equal to this number.
              * Rovers only move orthogonally.
              * Rover movement may be split between multiple rovers.
              * Rovers may move both on tiles and on the planet grid.
              * Rovers may backtrack.
              * **If the rover tracker is at the top of the track** and would
                advance, you do still move your rovers the indicated number
                of spaces.
          * If you move your rover onto a lifepod/meteorite, collect it and
            place it on your player board.
          * Anything (tile, biomass patch, meteorite) placed onto a rover
            destroys it and it is **removed from the game**.
          * If all your rovers have been destroyed, they do not place a
            rover when reaching a rover milestone.
      - name: Tech Resource Track
        text: |
          * When a player advances onto a tech milestone, they unlock
            a tech that can be used every round for the rest of the game
            (unless stated otherwise).
          * Level 4 advancement clarification: Only advance twice due to
            tile placement.  Do **not** advance twice due to synergy boosts,
            event cards, or tiles you did not place.
      - name: Biomass Resource Track
        text: |
          * When advancing onto a biomass milestone, collect a biomass patch
            and immediately place it on their planet following normal
            [placement rules](#place).
          * Placing biomass patches does **not** advance you on the biomass
            track.
      - name: Water Resource Track
        text: |
          * **In order to collect the water resource on the tile**, there
            must be at least 1 water terrain portion of the tile covering an
            ice space.
          * Water terrain is **not required** to be placed over ice.
      - name: Energy Resources
        text: |
          There is no energy resource track.  Instead, when a tile containing
          an energy resource is placed, you advance another resource based on
          the following 2 options:

          1. The non-energy resource on the tile you placed.
          2. The resource of any 1 terrain that is orthogonally adjacent to
             the energy terrain **area** established from your tile placement.
              * This means that you can access the resource *through* other
                adjacent energy tiles, not just the one you placed.
  - name: Game End
    id: game_end
    text: |
      The game ends in 1 of 2 ways. If playing with the [event module](#event),
      there is a 3rd way.

      1. A player cannot legally place a tile from their depot.
          * All players finish the round as normal and then the game is over.
          * Any player that cannot legally place a tile still chooses 1 and
            advances on the tracks for **both** resources on the tile, but
            does not place it.
      2. A depot is completely emptied of tiles.
          * The game ends at the end of the round where a depot was emptied.
      3. (Only if playing with the [event module](#event)) When the last
         card of the event deck is drawn, complete the current round.

      ## Scoring
      * **Before scoring**, all players:
          * Should place any biomass patches they have.
          * Should execute any end game corporation tech.
          * Should advance any tracker due to end game civ cards.

      1. Score points for every complete row and column on your planet.
          * The row/column cannot have a meteorite or empty grid square.
          * Each row/column scores 1-3 points based on the medal to the
            side/above it (respectively).
      2. Score the highest value medal that each tracker has reached/passed.
      3. Score points for the lifepods and meteorites collected.
          * 1 point per lifepod
          * 1 point per 3 meteorites (rounded down)
      4. Score points for end game civ cards.
      5. Score points for any completed private objectives.
      6. Score points based on the neighbor objective cards if your planet
         wins when compared with your neighbor's planet.

      * In case of a tie:
          1. The player with the fewest uncovered grid squares wins.
          2. The player with the fewest meteorites remaining on their planet
             wins.
          3. The players share the victory.

          * Each round, the depot is rotated clockwise by 1 depot instead of
            the commander choosing.
      - name: Private Objective Module
        id: private
        text: |
          * In a multiplayer game, you may optionally use private objectives
            in addition to neighbor objectives.
          * During setup, deal 2 private objectives to each player.  They
            choose 1 to keep and return the other to the box.
              * This should be done *before* neighbor objectives.
      - name: Event Deck Module
        id: event
        text: |
          * Setup
              1. Separate the event deck into 3 piles of cards separated by
                 event type (green, orange, red).
              2. Remove any solo mode cards.
              3. Create a deck of 20 cards to be used during the game by
                 randomly selecting cards from the different decks. You can
                 customize the event difficulty by choosing from the decks of
                 your choice.
          * Gameplay
              1. After the space station has been rotated, immediately draw
                 the next event card from the deck and execute its action.
                  * All actions **must** be executed, if possible, for all
                    events and all players.
              2. Play the rest of the round as normal
          * The last card of the event deck also triggers the game end.

      # Republic
      *Advantage: 7 x Civ milestones*  
      *Weaknesses: 1 x Rover, Regression*

      * Tech lvl 1 is an immediate gain of movement even before you place your
        tile.  If your rover tracker is not at a position with rover movement,
        do not gain any movement.
      * Tech lvl 2 example:
          * With tech lvl 2 unlocked, the player claims a rank 3 civ
            milestone.  The player picks up all cards from rand 3 plus 1 card
            at random from rank 4 and chooses 1 to keep. Then, return all
            unchosen cards to their respective piles.
      * Regress another tracker:  Move any non-civ resource tracker 1
        position downward on the resource track.  Do not claim benefits.

      # Wormhole Corp.
      *Advantage: Surplus biomass patches*  
      *Weaknesses: Tile placement restrictions*

      * Tech lvl 2 may be used to achieve biomass terrain connections, but
        you cannot place a biomass patch onto a meteorite.
      * Tech lvl 5 allows you to place a biomass patch onto a meteorite at
        game end, destroying the meteorite.

      # Cosmos Inc.
      *Advantage: Advancement engine*  
      *Weaknesses: Lifepod scoring, 1 x Rover, Lifepods cover benefits*

      * You may position lifepods such that a tracker skips over more than 1
        lifepod at a time.
      * Lifepods only score medals if they are on your scoring area at game
        end.  You may use your tech to reposition them onto a scoring area
        later in the game.

      # Horizon Group
      *Advantage: 4 x Rovers*  
      *Weaknesses: Pick up and deliver requirements*

      * Each rover may hold 1 meteorite on top of it.
          * A rover picks up a meteorite when it is placed onto, moves onto,
            or moves through a meteorite.
          * A rover delivers a meteorite it's carrying when it moves onto or
            through a rover resource.
          * A rover destroys a meteorite it carries when it moves onto
            water terrain.

      # Jump Drive
      *Advantage: Flexibility, 6 x Techs*  
      *Weaknesses: Lifepod scoring, 1 x Rover*

      * A tech may be used immediately when unlocked.
      * Be aware that Jump Drive has little incentive to advance their tech
        resource tracker, as they score fewer medals the further they
        advance tech.
      * Tech D: Treating tech resource as an energy resource during tile
        placement only applies to tile placement and not end of game
        resources.
      * Tech E: A row consists of 5 resource track positions that span across
        all resource tracks of the corp. board. as designated by the current
        tracker position.

      # Oasis Ultd.
      *Advantage: Tracker manipulation, Medals on the water track*  
      *Weaknesses: Long winding water track*

      * Instead of just advancing upward, your water tracker advances toward
        the end of the resource track, always following the irregular path.
      * Each resource tracker only scores medals once based on its
        corresponding resource track.
      * Tech lvl 1: A tracker must stay on its corresponding track.

      # Makeshift
      *Advantage: Flexibility, Tracker manipulation*  
      *Weaknesses: Resource dependency*

      * A resource tracker may block another resource tracker from advancing.
      * Resource trackers score medals based on the track they occupy at the
        end of the game.
      * Tech lvl 1: Trackers may advance diagonally from civ to tech and vice
        versa.
      * Tech lvl 3: A lateral shift is when a player moves a tracker
        horizontally to an adjacent resource track and claims the benefit.
      * Tech lvl 4: Regress -- Move a resource tracker 1 position down on the
        resource track.  Do **not** claim benefits.

      # Flux Industries
      *Advantage: Power level, Versatility*  
      *Weaknesses: 1 tech available at a time*

      * Tech lvl 2: When you unlock this, choose the flux track as normal.
        You may advance your tracker to the next milestone on the flux track
        any time before you unlock tech lvl 3.
      * Tech lvl 3: Only the benefits of the flux track are improved.
        Disregard all other improvements that do not correspond to the
        flux track.
      * Tech lvl 4: Collect a meteorite from your planet, if possible.
