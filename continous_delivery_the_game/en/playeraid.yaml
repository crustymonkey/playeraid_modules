name: Continuous Delivery - The Game
description: The Game is a cooperative game for 3-5 players.
             The game consists of a board with 20 spaces,
             where 10-20 cubes representing software work items shall be
             pushed forward according to the rules.
             The goal is to make the work items finish as soon as possible
             at the end space. A lot of set-backs will appear on cards
             drawn from a deck. The set-backs have names that people within
             the software development are familiar with.
             The cooperative game is won if the group manages to overcome
             all the trouble caused by the event cards, by choosing from
             the development cards and implement them in a proper order.

              be done randomly or by selecting what you

              and Operations need always be part of the
              game, otherwise Improvements cannot be
              invested in. If playing with four players
              add either Extra Resource or Continuous
              Delivery Expert to the game. If playing with
              five players, add both. It is possible to play
              with less than three players, in that case give
              more than one Role card to each player.
