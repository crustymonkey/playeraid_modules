      text: |
          When an enemy is encountered in the game, do the following:

          1. The app or location book will tell you how many enemies are
             generated, collect the figures for them.
          2. Unless otherwise instructed, place them on the entry space
             ![enemy](/static/img/familiar_tales/enemy.png).  If there's
             more than 1, divide them equally across each entry space.
          3. Review the encounters section in the location book.  If enemies
             have life tracks, place a life marker on the highest numbered
             slot.

          * ![gear](/static/img/familiar_tales/gear.png) **Spaces/Sections**:
            When a familiar moves onto one of these spaces, read the section

          * **Forage Spaces**: Familiars can forage for the indicated resources
            on these spaces.

    - name: Skill Tests
      text: |
          Skill tests will be required to pass many things in the game,
          including enemy encounters.  Follow these steps to resolve the
          tests:

          1. Play any number of skill cards from your hand, 1 at a time.  As
             you play them, resolve its [icon effect](#icon_effects)
             (upper left).  Note that some skill cards have additional effects
             when played to specific types of skill tests. **Other players can
             also play cards with the chain
             ![link](/static/img/familiar_tales/link.png) icon to assist**.
          2. After all skill cards have been played, count the total skill
             value from cards played (including from other players) and any
             relevant bonuses.
          3. Roll the chance die:
              * If you roll a positive, add it to your skill total.
              * If you roll a negative, subtract it from your skill total.
              * If you roll a danger
                ![danger](/static/img/familiar_tales/danger.png) symbol, add
                1 danger in the app.
              * If you roll a power
                ![power](/static/img/familiar_tales/power.png) symbol **and
                pass the test**, add 1 power to your familiar.
              * If your total is >= the difficulty, you pass and resolve the
                pass effect. Otherwise, resolve the fail effect (if there is 1).
          4. Discard all cards played into that skill test. Players who also
             played link ![link](/static/img/familiar_tales/link.png) cards
             should also discard those.

          After turning to a location book page, and doing the starting setup,
          players will begin taking turns and the app will tell you whose turn
          it is.  Each turn consists of 2 phases.
      sections:

                        dashed lines take 2 movement to cross. **Familiars can't

                      skill test using the difficulty number in the top right
                      of the current page.  If the familiar passes, cover one

                      ![done](/static/img/familiar_tales/done.png) token and

                        item equipped, place it face up near that familiar.
                        Item bonuses and effects are only active when equipped.
                      * **Stash**: This is a face down pile of cards the

                * **Ranged Attack**: The enemy will target a familiar it does
                  **not** share a space with and has line of sight to. If there
                  is more than 1 target, players decide.
          - name: Defending with a Familiar
            text: |
                When a familiar you control has been targeted, they may defend
                if the player has skill cards in their hand.  If so:

                1. Make a resilience
                   ![shield](/static/img/familiar_tales/shield.png) skill test
                   with that familiar.  The difficulty of the test is equal to
                   the enemy's melee or ranged attack value.
                2. If the familiar passes the test, it takes no damage. If they
                   fail, subtract the test result from the enemy's attack
                   value and take that much damage.

                If a familiar does not defend, they take the full value of the
                enemy's attack.

            text: |
                If a familiar's life reaches zero, the familiar is defeated.
                Do the following in order:

                1. Remove that familiar's figure from the board and place it
                   on its character card.
                2. Misfortune ![crow](/static/img/familiar_tales/crow.png) +2.
                3. Acquire 2 Fatigue.
                4. Set that familiar's life dial to its max.
                5. That familiar becomes Badly Injured and places the affliction
                   token on its card.

                **Returning to play**: At the start of the defeated familiar's
                next turn, return it to play on any space containing another
                familiar. If there are no other familiars, place it on a
                ![flag](/static/img/familiar_tales/flag.png) or
                ![fire](/static/img/familiar_tales/fire.png) space.
          - name: Fatigue Cards
            text: |
                When you are instructed to draw Fatigue cards, take them from
                the pile.  When you play a Fatigue card, **return it to the
                supply instead of your discard pile**.  If a player is
                instructed to take a Fatigue card, but there are none in the
                supply, nothing happens.

            text: |
                When a character gets an affliction, place to corresponding
                token on their character card.  If there are no tokens of that
                type available, ignore the effect.

                ![fire](/static/img/familiar_tales/on_fire.png) **On Fire**:
                When this happens, banish any items equipped to it that have
                the Flammable keyword.  At the start of that familiar's turn,
                reduce its life by 1, then roll the chance die.  If a positive
                number is rolled, remove the affliction. If a danger
                ![danger](/static/img/familiar_tales/danger.png) is rolled,
                +1 danger.  If an On Fire familiar enters a water space, remove
                this affliction.  As an action, an On Fire familiar can make
                a resilience ![shield](/static/img/familiar_tales/shield.png)
                test with a difficulty of 4; remove it on success.

                ![poison](/static/img/familiar_tales/poison.png) **Poisoned**:
                At the start of the familiar's turn, reduce its life by 1, then
                roll the chance die and remove the affliction on a positive
                number. If danger
                ![danger](/static/img/familiar_tales/danger.png) is rolled,
                danger +1. When this familiar is healed, remove the affliction.

                ![trap](/static/img/familiar_tales/trap.png) **Trapped**:
                A trapped familiar cannot move from its current space. When
                a trapped familiar loses life, it loses 1 additional life. As
                an action, the familiar can make a might
                ![might](/static/img/familiar_tales/might.png) test with a
                difficulty of 4. On success, remove this affliction.

                ![injured](/static/img/familiar_tales/injured.png) **Badly
                Injured**: When a familiar loses life, it loses 1 additional
                life. When the familiar is healed, remove this affliction.

                **Knocked Down**: When a familiar is knocked down, lay it on
                its side. The next time that familiar moves, 2 move points
                must be used to stand up.  Enemies represented by tokens
                can't be knocked down.
          - name: Marks of Devotion
            text: |
                When a familiar gains a mark of devotion, they choose a mark
                of devotion token and place it on the familiar's character
                card.  For each token it will add +1 to the matching type of
                skill test. **If a player would get a mark, but there are
                none of that type left, the player receives nothing**.
