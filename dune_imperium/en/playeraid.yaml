              text: |
                  * Play 1 card face up in front of you to send an agent to
                    an **unoccupied** space with a matching symbol from the
                    left hand side of the card.
                      * You **cannot** send multiple agents on a turn even
                        if your card shows multiple symbols.
                      * You must pay any costs/meet requirements of the chosen
                        board space. The board space cost must be paid
                        **immediately** (before getting any space/card
                        benefits).
                      * Gain the effect of the board space.
                      * If there is an effect in the Agent box ("gray" area"),
                        you can activate that (this and the board space effect
                        can be done in any order).
                      * If you placed your agent on a faction space, move your
                        faction cube up 1 space.
                      * ⇨ symbols indicate a cost, either on cards or board
                        spaces.
                          * You never *have to* pay this cost (but you won't
                            get the benefit if you don't, of course).
            - name: Reveal Turn
              text: |
                  When a player is out of agents, or just chooses to do this
                  turn early, the player takes a Reveal turn.

                  * Reveal all cards remaining in your hand and place them
                    face up in front of you, but separate from previously
                    played cards.
                  * You may now gain the reveal effect (blue box at the bottom
                    of the card) from the revealed cards.
                  * You may use Persuasion ([blue ◇]!blue! symbols) to
                    aquire new cards at any point during your reveal turn.
                      * You can aquire any of the 5 cards in the imperium row
                        and, additionally, *Arrakis Liaison* or *The Spice
                        Must Flow*.
                      * You may buy more than 1 card.
                      * Acquired cards are placed in your discard pile.
                      * Any unused Persuasion is lost at the end of your turn.
                      * **Cards in the imperium row are immediately replaced**.
                  * Set your strength: Set your total strength on the combat
                    track for this round.
                      * Each troop (cube) in **the conflict** (not in your
                        garrison) counts for 2 strength.
                      * Each sword symbol is worth 1 strength.
                      * **You must have at least 1 troop in the conflict to
                        have any strength**.
                      * Set your marker to the total strength.  If >20, flip
                        the token to the +20 side.
                  * At the end of this turn, put all your played cards in your
                    discard pile.

              See [Other Rules](#other_rules) for more information on managing
              your troops.

              1. Beginning with the player with the 1st player marker, each
                 player **with at least 1 troop in the conflict** may play
                 any number of combat intrigue cards or pass.
                  * You are **not** required to pass if you have previously
                    passed.
                  * All players must pass *consecutively* to end this phase.
                  * If a card changes the number of troops a player has in
                    the conflict, they must adjust their combat marker
                    accordingly.
                      * If a player ends up with 0 troops in the conflict,
                        **their strength is set to 0**.
                  * If you have a combat intrigue card with "when you win a
                    conflict", don't play these now.
              2. Resolve the combat by giving the rewards from the current
                 conflict card based on player strength (highest wins).
                  * The 3rd place reward is only given in a 4 player game.
                  * A player with 0 strength (no troops in the conflict) does
                    **not** receive a reward.
                  * Ties:
                      * If the tie is for 1st place, the tied players receive
                        the 2nd reward. In a 4 player game, the other 2 players
                        compete for the 3rd place reward.
                      * When players tie for 2nd place, they both receive the
                        3rd reward.
                      * Players tying for 3rd place receive nothing.
                  * All players return the troops in the conflict to their
                    supply, **not their garrison**.
                  * Reset combat markers to 0 on the combat track.

              * All spaces with a Maker icon (*The Great Flat*, *Hagga Basin*,
                and *Imperial Basin*) that do not have an agent on them receive
                1 spice on designated space.
                  * This is in addition to any previously placed spice.

              If any player has reached 10 points **or** if the conflict deck
              is empty, the [end game](#game_end) is triggered.

              If not:

              * Return the Mentat to its space in the Landsraad.
              * Players recall their agents from the board.
              * Pass the 1st player marker clockwise.
              * Start the next round with [Phase 1](#phase_1)
    - name: Game End
      id: game_end
      text: |
          If a player has reached 10 points or the conflict deck is empty at
          the [end of a round](#recall), the game ends.

          The player with the most points wins, but if there are ties, the
          tie breakers are:

          1. The player with the most leftover spice.
          2. The player with the most leftover Solari.
          3. The player with the most leftover water.
          4. The player with the most garrisoned troops.

          ## Deploying troops to the conflict.

          * Whenever the cube icon is gained (card or on the board), you take
            1 troop from your supply and place it in your garrison (not in
            the conflict).
              * The troops in your supply are limited.
          * When you send an agent to a combat board space (⚔ icon), you
            may deploy troops from your garrison to the conflict.
              * You may deploy any/all troops recruited during your current
                turn plus **up to 2 more troops from your garrison**.

          ## Control Bonuses

          * Some conflict cards reward a player with control over 1 of 3
            spaces on the board (*Arrakeen*, *Carthag*, or *Imperial Basin*),
            based on the card's title.
              * If you win such a conflict, place 1 of your control markers
                on the designated space on the board.
              * While your marker is on the this space, you receive the bonus
                shown any time an agent is sent to that space (including yours).
              * When a conflict card is revealed for a space you already
                control, you receive a bonus: You may deploy 1 troop from your
                **supply** to the conflict.

          ## Leaders

          * Each leader has 2 abilities.
              * The one on the left is used as described.
              * The one marked with the signet ring is activated when you
                play your signet ring card on an agent turn.

          ## Factions

          * Faction cubes begin at the bottom of their respective tracks, but
            will move up as a player gains influence with that faction.
          * When you reach the 2nd space on an influence track, gain a victory
            point.
              * **If you drop below the 2nd space, you lose that victory
                point!**
          * When you reach the 4th space on an influence track, take the bonus
            shown on that space.
              * If you drop below the 4th space, you do *not* return this bonus.
          * The **1st** player to reach 4 influence with a faction earns the
            alliance token for that faction and 1 victory point.
              * If they are ever **passed** on that track (a player moves to a
                **higher** space), the alliance token
                is given to the player that passed them. They also lose the
                victory point associated with the token.

          ## Intrigue Cards

          There are 3 types of intrigue cards:

          * You may play a Plot card any time during 1 of your agent or reveal
            turns.
          * You may play a Combat card only during combat.
          * You may play an Endgame card only at the end of the game.

          * **Baron Vladimir Harkonnen**: To use the Masterstroke ability,
            choose 2 of the 4 Baron tokens and place them on your leader with
            the Faction side face down.
              * The other 2 tokens are returned to the box.
              * Later, reveal your tokens for their rewards.
          * **Bindu Suspension**: You must play this intrigue card at the
            start of your agent turn, **before doing anything else**. When you
            do, draw a card and immediately end your turn.
          * **Calculated Hire**: This intrigue card can only take the Mentat
            from its starting position in the Landsraad.
          * **Demand Respect**: If you win a conflict that rewards you with
            spice, you may take that 1st and use it to play this card.
          * **Kwisatz Haderach**: You may play this to take an agent turn even
            if you have no agents left in your supply.
              * As this lets you send an agent already on the board, you may
                send an agent to the same space it's already on.
              * If a board space can only be used once per game (*High
                Council* or *Swordmaster*), you **cannot** use this to send
                an agent there more than once.
              * You can't overcome *The Voice* and send an agent to a board
                space where you can't send an agent.
              * If this vacates a space with a Maker icon and no one else
                occupies this space, it *will* get bonus spice during [Phase
                4](#phase_4)
          * **Paul Atreides / Poison Snooper**: You can't look at the top
            card of your deck if it's empty. This does **not** allow you
            to reshuffle your discard to form a new deck.
          * **Test of Humanity**: Opponents make choices starting on your
            left and proceeding clockwise. Each opponent must choose something
            they can actually do.
              * They cannot choose to discard a card if their hand is empty.
              * They cannot lose a deployed troop if they have none.
              * If they choose to discard a card, they get to the choose the
                card (not random).
          * **The Voice**: Use 1 of your available control markers to mark the
            board space you choose. **Remove it on your next turn** as it
            only blocks the space for 1 turn.
              * This does prevent the *Kwisatz Haderach* from sending an agent
                to this board space.
