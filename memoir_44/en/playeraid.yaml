          The object of the game is to win a number of victory medals based on
          the scenario.

          * A victory medal is earned when an entire enemy unit is defeated.
            Place the last defeated enemy on a medal space on your side in
            the bottom left part of the board.
          * Some scenarios will give additional medals for certain battlefield
            objectives.

                      * You **may not give more than 1 order to each unit**.
                        If the card allows you to give more orders than you

                  text: |
                      * Movements are announced and made sequentially, 1 unit
                        at a time, but in any order.
                          * **A unit may only move once per turn**.
                          * An ordered does not have to move.
                      * You must complete 1 unit's movement before beginning
                        another.
                      * All unit movements **must** be completed before
                        starting the [Battle phase](#battle).
                      * Units may move between sections on the map.
                      * **Only 1 unit may occupy a hex at any time**. When
                        moving units, you may **not** move through a hex
                        occupied by a friendly or enemy unit.
                      * You cannot split individual figures off from a unit.

                      * Units that are reduced via casualties cannot combine
                        with other units.
                      * Some terrain affects movement and may prevent the
                        unit from moving or battling.
                      * Retreat movement is done a bit differently.

                      ### Infantry Movement
                      * An infantry unit may move 1 hex and battle **or**

                      * Battles are checked and resolved 1 at a time, but in
                        the order of your choosing. 1 battle must be completed
                        before starting another.
                      * A unit may only battle once per turn.
                      * An ordered unit does not have to battle.
                      * A unit may not split its battle dice between multiple
                        targets.
                      * The number of casualties a unit suffers does not
                        affect the number of dice it will roll.
                      * A unit attacking an adjacent enemy is in *Close
                        Assault* with that enemy.
                      * A unit attacking an enemy more than 1 hex away is
                        said to *Fire* at the enemy.
                      * A unit adjacent to an enemy unit **must** *Close
                        Assault* that enemy.

                      ### Battle Procedure
                      1. Announce the attacking unit and its target.
                          1. Verify that your target is within battle range
                             or contact.
                              * **Infantry**: The unit may battle any target
                                3 or fewer hexes away. 1 hex away, 3 dice;
                                2 hexes away, 2 dice; 3 hexes away, 1 die.
                              * **Armor**: The unit may battle any target 3
                                or fewer hexes away. Always roll 3 dice.
                              * **Artillery**: The unit may battle any target
                                6 or fewer hexes away. The dice, starting
                                from the 1st hex, are: 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1.
                          2. Verify that your target is within line of site.
                              * If a line can be drawn, unobstructed, from
                                the center of the unit's hex to the center of
                                the enemy's hex, it's in line of sight.
                              * Terrain **in** a target hex does **not** block
                                line of sight.
                              * If the imaginary line runs along the edges
                                of other hexes, line of sight is blocked when
                                obstructions are on **both** sides of the line.
                      2. Determine the number of battle dice based on battle
                         range (above).
                      2. Check terrain and obstacles for any reductions of
                         battle dice for units on that terrain or obstacle.
                      3. Resolve the battle.
                          * Hits are resolved 1st, followed by retreats.
                          * Hits are scored for each dice symbol matching
                            the attacking unit (infantry symbol for infantry).
                          * Grenades act as "wild" hits. They are **always**
                            a hit.
                          * If more hits are rolled than there are figures,
                            the additional hits are lost.
                          * "Star" symbols are misses, but may have effects
                            from the command card.
                          * "Flag" symbols cause the enemy unit to retreat 1
                            space for each symbol rolled.
                              * The player controlling the unit decides the
                                space a unit retreats to.
                              * Terrain has no effect on retreat moves.
                                Impassable terrain is still impassable when
                                retreating.
                              * A retreating unit may not retreat onto or
                                through a hex containing another unit.
                              * If a unit cannot retreat (edge of map,
                                impassable terrain, etc.), it loses 1 figure
                                for each space it would have to retreat.
                              * Some obstacles will allow units to ignore the
                                1st flag rolled against them.
                          * **Taking Ground**:
                              * When a unit in *Close Assault* forces an enemy
                                to retreat, it may "take ground" by moving
                                into the vacated hex.
                              * An artillery unit may **not** take ground.
                              * Terrain movement and battle restrictions still
                                apply.
                              * When an armor unit eliminates or forces the
                                enemy to retreat, if my advance into the
                                vacated hex and perform an *Armor Overrun*.
                          * **Armor Overrun**:
                              * On a successful *Close Assault*, the armor
                                unit may move into the vacated hex and perform
                                a 2nd battle.
                              * A unit may "take ground" again after a
                                successful overrun combat.
                              * **An armor unit may only make 1 overrun combat
                                during a turn**. (no chaining)
                              * All battles, *Close Assault*, and overrun
                                combats must be completed before the next
                                unit can battle.

                * **Battle**: A unit on sandbags is protected on all sides,
                  **not just along the edges where the sandbags are placed**.

                        * For infantry and armor, the battle dice are reduced
                          by 1.
                        * Artillery does not reduce battle dice.
                    * A unit with sandbags ignores the 1st flag rolled against
                      it.

                * **Movement**: A unit that enters a wire hex must stop and

                * **Battle**: An infantry unit on a wire hex reduces the number
                  of battle dice it rolls by 1.
                    * An infantry unit that can battle may remove the wire
                      **instead of battling**.
                    * Armor **must** remove the wire, but may still battle.
                * **Line of sight**: Wire does not block line of sight.
