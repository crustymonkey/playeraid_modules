          The game is played in a number of rounds, with each turn consisting
          of the following:

          1. Grow your trees by increasing the dice by 2 (if you have any).
             Note that you won't do this on your 1st turn.
          2. Choose an action from the action wheel and execute it. You can
             also buy a bonus action and perform free actions.  **These can
             be done in any order**.
          3. You can buy points via the track in the upper left of your
             player board..

          **You have the option to buy 1 bonus action on your turn**. Pay 3
          lanterns and choose an action tile to perform the action, **but
          do not move the tile** and do not collect any bonuses for it
          (outer edge or central saw blade).
      sections:
        - name: The Action Wheel
          text: |
              * **You will always choose and move 1 action tile, regardless
                of whether you use the action printed on it**.
              * **Note that any tile on the board can be chosen** unless it
                cannot be advanced (see the "lap" rule below).
              * On each turn, you choose 1 action tile and move it to from
                its current quadrant to the 1st open space (counter-clockwise
                order) in the next quadrant (in clockwise order).
                  * **NOTE**: If there is a "gap" in the action tiles in the
                    next quadrant, do **not** fill that in. Always place your
                    action tile counter-clockwise to the action tile furthest
                    counter-clockwise in that quadrant.
              * If you choose an action tile with a bonus beneath it, gain that
                bonus.
                  * Note that the bonuses in the starting quadrant are covered
                    by the arc tile. **Once all action tiles have "left" the
                    starting quadrant, remove the arc tile**.
              * If you choose a tile in a quadrant showing a bonus(es) in the
                central saw blade, take that bonus.
              * If you move an action tile past the black arrow, rotate the
                saw blade 1 quadrant clockwise.
              * **Action tiles are not allowed to enter a quadrant that is 1
                lap ahead**.
                  * Another way of putting this:  The action tile cannot cross
                    the black arrow into a quadrant that is not empty.
              * Instead of taking the action printed on the tile, you may:
                  * Gain 3 blueberries
                  * Pay 1 lantern to perform the action on any other tile
                    (instead of the chosen tile).

                  * You may buy 1 or 2 dice from the corner of the action wheel
                    board.
                  * The cost for the die depends on the value and color of the
                    die, so it is the number on the die plus the following
                    additional costs:
                      * [Green die]!green!: +0 blueberries
                      * [Yellow die]!#D9A51A!: +1 blueberry
                      * [Brown die]!brown!: +2 blueberries
                  * After taking dice, roll new dice to replace the one(s) you
                    took. Place them on the matching spaces on the board.
                  * Acquired dice are placed on the lumber spaces on your board.
                      * If you exceed the number of spaces on your board, you
                        must use them during your turn or lose them at the
                        end of your turn.

                  2. You may also buy 6 value die, but **it must be a different
                     color** than the die you sold in step #1 (if you sold a
                     die).

                  from the items set next to your player board during setup:

                  ## Pots

                  * You can add a pot by paying the blueberry cost and placing

                    trees when taking the [plant action](#a_plant)

                  ## Sawing Tiles

                  * Add a saw tile in the next available open slot (right to

                     next [income phase](#income)**.
                  2. Choose one of your dice that is not a 1.
                  3. You may make 1 free cut and take a die from the supply
                     and set the values to a sum equaling the original die.
                     e.g. if you have 5 die, you can change it to a 1 and take
                     a 4 die of the same color from the supply.
                      * You may use saw blade tokens for additional cuts, 1
                        saw token for each additional cut. e.g. If you have
                        a 5 die, you could spend 2 saw blade tokens to
                        split it to a 1, 1, 1, and 2 of the same color.

                  3. Set 1 die to the sum of the 2 values and return the
                     other to the bank. If they are different colors, you
                     choose the color to keep.
                  4. If the dice were different color, **score 4 points**.
                  5. Flip the gluing tile the ❌ side. **It is
                     now unavailable until the next [income phase](#income)**.

                  * You can move a die from your pot to your lumber yard.
                  * If a die in a pot reaches 6, it **must** be moved to your
                    lumber yard.
                  * Note that you can not use any abilities to change the value
                    of dice in your pots.
                  * Each tree grows by a value of 2 at the beginning of each
                    of your turns.

                  General notes:

                  * You have 1 order at the start of the game.
                  * You will place orders from your hand next to your board
                    during [income phases](#income).
                  * You can have multiple orders in the same row.
                  * If an order ever "drops off" the bottom row (or is not
                    completed at the end of the game), you discard the order
                    and move back 2 spaces on the reputation track.

                  To complete an order:

                  1. Return the required dice and tokens to the supply.
                      * **Dice must match colors and values exactly**.
                  2. Gain the reward shown on the left hand side of the order.
                  3. Gain the reward *or pay the penalty* shown on your board
                     for the current row.
                  4. Place the order face down near your board for end of game
                     scoring.

                  ## Hazelnut Orders and Public Contracts

                  * When a hazelnut order is completed, you have a choice of
                    claiming a public contract *or* the depicted instant
                    reward.
                  * If you claim a public contract, place 1 of your counters
                    on it.
                      * Other players can also claim the same contract
                        **during the same round**. The contract can no longer
                        be claimed by anyone after the completion of the
                        round it was claimed in.
                      * Remove the claimed contract from the row of available
                        contracts at the end of the round.

              text: |
                  * Whenever you get a tool, immediately place it in your
                    attic on an empty space.
                  * You can only place them in your bottom row until you
                    can "support" the tool in the next row above it (2
                    adjacent tools in a row can support a tool in the row
                    above it).
                      * The 2 end spaces on the top row break this rule. You
                        can place in these spaces once the adjacent
                        tile has been placed.
                  * When you place a tool, you collect the reward between it
                    and any adjacent tools **as long as the tools are
                    different**.
        - name: End of Turn
          text: |
              * You may "buy" points by moving up to the next space on the
                marketing track, paying the cost in blueberries, and receiving
                the depicted points.
                  * This is **not** required.
                  * If you reach the final space, you can still advance by
                    paying 12 blueberries to get 11 points (as depicted on
                    the final space).
              * You may only keep 6 dice in your lumber pile. You **must**
                discard down to 6 dice if you have more than that.
                  * Reminder: If you have a 6 value die in a pot, it **must**
                    be moved to your lumber pile.

              The round ends after everyone has taken 1 turn.

              * Move the round marker to the next space. Note that there may
                be an [income phase](#income) between rounds.

              Perform the following, in order:

              1. Players move orders down 1 row. If an order moves off the
                 board, move back 2 spaces on the reputation track.
              2. Each player **must** play an order from the their hand. Note
                 that your hand will be empty in the 4th income phase.
              3. Each player gains blueberries and points based on their
                 levels on the blueberry and hazelnut tracks (respectively).
              4. Players reset their splicing, gluing, and saw tiles.
              5. After rounds 4 and 12, discard the helper and order from the
                 slot marked with an "X", slide the cards and draw a new card
                 for each.
              6. After round 8, replace the helper and order decks with their
                 late game versions.

          The game ends after the final income phase.

          ## Final Scoring
          In addition to the points scored during the game:

          * Score points as depicted on any public contracts you claimed.
          * Score points for "leftovers": Sum the value of the following
            items and divide by 10 (rounded down) and score that many
            points:
              * Values of unused dice (sum them)
              * Remaining blueberries
              * Remaining scrapwood
              * Glue
              * Saw blade tokens
          * For each uncompleted order, move **back** 2 spaces on the
            reputation track.
          * For each completed order, score points based on how far you
            have progressed on the reputation track.

          The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the player
          who played later in every round wins.

          ## Tracks

          * Note that there are rewards (a tool and points) on the hazelnut
            and blueberry tracks that are taken when you advance past them
            on either/both tracks.
          * The reputation track has 2 reward tiles that can be claimed when
            you move to their slots.
              * **4 players**: The 1st player here gets the top reward, the
                2nd gets the middle reward, and the 3rd gets the bottom
                reward.
              * **2 players**: The 1st player to reach tile takes the middle
                reward.
              * **If 2 players reach the tile during the same round, they
                both receive the same reward**.
                  * For example, in a 4 player game, if 2 players reach the
                    tile (1st and 2nd) in the same round, they both get
                    the top reward. The next player to reach that tile
                    gets the bottom reward.

          ## End of the Track

          * If you advance past the end of the hazelnut or blueberry income
            tracks, leave your counter on 10 and add another counter on the
            1 space (or as far as you should advance) as well.
          * If you would go past the end of the reputation track, score 2
            points for each space beyond it you would advance.
