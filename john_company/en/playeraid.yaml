        * Over the course of the game, players will advance the members of their family through positions in the East India Company, hoping to improve their family's wealth and their reputation in polite society. The character of each game of John Company is determined by the performance of the Company, which is jointly operated by all the players. The Company will usually attempt to establish a profitable trade and a political foothold in India, but its goals are largely dependent upon the players. 

        * *Regions* There are eight region cards that represent an area comprising modern-day Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.
            * Economic status - A region is either prosperous or depressed. The economic status of a region is indicated by which side of the card is face up, either the prosperous side (plain) or the depressed side (greyscale with striped watermark).
            * Political status - A region is either dominated or sovereign. A region can be dominated by another region or the Company. Dominated regions and their dominator are collectively referred to as an empire. When a region is dominated, the right column of its event table is covered by the dominator.  Sovereign regions have the right column of their event table clearly visible. 
            * Trade status - A region is either open or closed to British trade. Closed regions are placed to the left of the board. Regions that are open are placed above the board near one of the three presidencies. 

        * *Offices* Throughout the game, players gain and lose control of offices within the East India Company. A player's family members (cubes) move through the Company via promotion. In general, writers are promoted first to senior offices and then to executive offices.
            * When a player controls an office, they place one of their cubes on the slot associated with that office. This cube is known as the officeholder and will allow its owner to control different aspects of the Company's behavior.
            * Most commonly, officeholders leave the Company through Attrition, which is the primary scoring mechanism in the game.
            * When an officeholder leaves the Company due to Attrition, the owning player may move that cube onto a prize card, exchanging money for victory points and special abilities.

        * *Family* cards represent the different family interests in the company. Each of the six player cards has a unique benefit.

        * *Money* moves and its location matters. Money must always be located in a family treasury (near a player) or an office treasury. The Company brings most of the money into the game through its trade in India. Players may earn a share of this money through Dividends or by placing their family members in various key offices and profiteering from the Company's activities.
            * White = 1£
            * Red = 5£
            * Blue = 10£

        * *Cubes* represent a players family. Players are restricted by the cubes in their stocks. If a player without remaining cubes needs to place one or more cubes, that player must use their cubes on any prize card or the manor resource box.

        * *Cards* Other than regions, provinces, and families, there is an Evening Post deck where events are drawn, and Prize cards where player cubes removed through attrition can retire to for victory points and some special abilities.

        * *Negotiations & Promise Cubes* Players are free to discuss the game and negotiate during play. Players are not held to any promises of actions on future phases or game turns, but may give each other the following items
            * Family-owned money and ships.
            * Promises on their family card. 
            * Family cubes from their stock, which are called Promise Cubes. As part of a negotiation, a player may offer one or more cubes from their stock. These cubes are held by the player accepting the offer and are now called promises. At the end of the game, players lose two victory points for each of their promises held by another player.
            * A promise cube must be returned to its owner player if, at any time:
                * You pay the player holding the promise cube £2.
                * You show hiring preference by promoting the player holding the promise over at least one other player.
                * The holder returns the promise. If you have one of the holder's promises, it is returned to him. 
        
           
 - name: Setup

        * *Early Company Scenario* - There are several setup and play scenarios detailed in the rules; this guide covers the Early Company game for 4 to 6 players (see the rules for 2-3 players, solo play, and a longer Campaign game). 
        * Place the board in the center of the table. Use the colorful John Company side (not the back side labeled "John & Co.")
        * Deal out six random prize cards face-up and place them in a row at the bottom of the board. 
        * Remove "Monopoly Revoked" and "Revoke Monopoly" from the Evening Post cards. Shuffle the rest of the deck and place it facedown on the top right of the board. 
        * Place a status marker (black cube) on the
            * 4 space of the share price track
            * 1 space of the game turn track
            * 0 space of the Company revenue track
            * Center space of the Balance of India
            * Picture of parliament on the bottom right side of the board. 
        * Place a black disk on the officeholder slot of the China Office.
        * Give each player a set of colored cubes, a Family card to place in front of them (family side face-up) and a starting treasury of £5.
        * Each player takes a number of starting cubes determined by the player count. Place these cubes above the player's family card.
            * Four players: 6 starting cubes each
            * Five or Six players: 5 starting cubes each
        * Then, each player takes an additional 12 cubes of their color and places them below their family card. These cubes form the player's stock.
        * Any remaining cubes, Prize cards, and unused Evening Post cards are returned to the box. 
        * Starting with a random player and proceeding clockwise, each player places one of their starting cubes on any available vacancy (the empty squares along the blue ribbon).
        * Once each player has filled a vacancy, repeat the process in the reverse order, with the player who previously placed last taking the next turn. Continue until all vacancies are filled.
        * When a cube is placed on an executive office (denoted by an "E" and a gold square), an additional starting cube of that color is placed on the Court of Directors.
        * After all vacancies in the Company are filled, players roll one die for each of their remaining starting cubes and place the cube in the resource box corresponding to the die roll.
        * Shipyard cubes are placed in the highest empty slot in any column (so the 6 slot must be filled in any column before the 5 slot).
        * NOTE: For your first game you can pick a start player as Chairman, and then in vacancies in order along the blue ribbon from the Chairman.

             * If a nominee receives a simple majority support, the Chairman election is over. The successful nominee moves one of their share cubes from the Court of Directors to the Chairman office.
             * If the nomination fails, the player to the left of the previous nominator makes the next nomination and the process repeats.
             * If the Court fails to agree upon a nominee (after each player makes one nomination), the former Chairman decides who of the failed nominees becomes the new Chairman.

             * Nepotism. When filling any office, except the Chairman, players are penalized for Nepotism. If a player promotes their own cube over another player's cube, the promoting player must give one of their cubes from their stock as a promise to every player with at least one eligible candidate.

 - name: Phase 3 - Trade Activities - Revenues, Expenses, Dividends, and Bailouts
   text: |
        * Player revenue is generated in several ways and always comes from the bank.
            * Tax. Place money equal to the current tax value of their regions on each provincial office that currently exists. If a player occupies that office, he may transfer any portion of this game turn's tax revenue to his family's treasury or the region's presidency immediately.
            * Presidential Bonuses. The family controlling each presidency takes money equal to the number of fulfilled orders on regions in that presidency.
            * Interlopers. Each family takes £2 for each of their ships with a captain. 
            * Other Revenue. The "Investment Bank" and "South Seas Firm" prizes provide additional revenue as described on the card. The Sykes and Paxton families also generate revenue according to their special powers described on their family cards.
        * Company Expenses are managed by the Chairman, paid using the revenue gained from filling orders. As expenses are paid, the Chairman should adjust the revenue marker on the revenue track.
        * The following expenses are paid to the bank
            * Debt Service. Pay £1 for each black disk on the Court of Directors. 
            * Military Upkeep. Pay £1 for each gun and officer in a presidency.
            * Country Trade. Pay £1 for each captain on a ship.
            * If Company expenses cannot be met, take enough £5 Emergency Loans to cover the remaining expenses. Add a black disk to the Court of Directors for each £5 taken. Any portion "left over" must be immediately allocated to any Company treasuries. Any new loans do not need to be paid for until next game turn.
        * Dividends must be paid to family treasuries
            * The Chairman may choose to pay dividends with remaining Company revenue. The cost of paying one dividend is £1 from the bank given to each player per cube they have in the Court of Directors. Update the revenue track to indicate how much revenue remains to be allocated. Multiple dividends may be paid. If more than one dividend is paid, increase the share price one space. If no dividend is paid, the share price falls one space. Dividends may not be paid with money from Emergency Loans
            * Angry Shareholders. 
        * After paying expenses and distributing dividends, the Chairman must allocate all remaining revenue to office treasuries. Place money from the bank into treasuries, then update the revenue track to indicate how much revenue remains to be allocated. Money allocated to treasuries may be spent during the next Company Phase.
        * Continue until the revenue track is reduced to 0.
        * A Bailout occurs when the share price would fall below "3." If the Company share price is at "3" a Dividend must be paid if possible. Emergency Loans cannot be used to pay this dividend. If the dividend cannot be paid, a Bailout occurs.
            * First, reduce shares. If a player only has a single cube in the Court of Directors, it is returned to their stock.
            * If a player has more than one cube in the Court of Directors, all but one cube are returned to their stock.
            * Then, reset the share price to "3."
            * Finally, each executive officeholder (including the Chairman) must vacate and may score a prize if the owner pays an additional £2 to the bank for each prize cube.
            * If, after reducing shares during a Bailout, no player cubes remain in the Court of Directors, the game is over. Each officeholder in an executive office subtracts three victory points from their owner's final score. 

 - name: Phase 4 - Evening Post
   text: |
        * Draw the top card from the Evening Post deck and place it face- up on top of the discard pile then resolve the events. Each Evening Post card has three steps. Events in India, Attrition, and Local News which will either be a Domestic Event or a Proposed Law.

   sections:     
      - name: Events in India
        text: |        
             * Each game turn there are a number of Events in India. 
             * The region where these events take place depends upon the movement of the Elephant. The Elephant moves as many times as indicated by the large number on the game turn's Evening Post card.
             * Unless redirected by Conquest or Revolt, the Elephant's moves are dictated by each region's number and it will move to the next higher region e.g. from Punjab (1) the Elephant moves to Maratha (2), and if the Elephant is in Madras (8), its next move will be to Punjab (1).
             * An event occurs in each region the Elephant visits.
             * When the Elephant moves to a new region roll the event dice to determine the event based on the region stability, indicated by the marker on the Balance of India track at the bottom left of the board.
                 * During order, two dice are rolled and the lowest result is used.
                 * During chaos, two dice are rolled and the highest result is used.
                 * During equilibrium, only a single die is rolled to determine the event
             * The Balance of India may change over the course of play. These changes are called tilts. When a tilt occurs, the marker on the Balance of India track moves towards the direction of the tilt. If the marker was already in the space it tilted towards, it does not move.
             * After resolving the event, if additional events remain to be resolved, the Elephant continues its move and repeat this process as another event occurs.
             * Events include
                 * **Conquest** The acting region attempts to conquer the target region, which is listed below the Conquest event icon.
                     * If the target region has already been conquered by the acting region, follow the black arrow to the first unconquered region and attempt to conquer that region instead.
                     * If all regions are dominated, the event should be treated as a Status Quo event.
                     * To resolve the conquest, compare its strength (the number next to the cannon) to the target's defense, which is the sum of its defense value and that of all of its dominions.
                     * If a region within a Presidency (not dominated) is attacked, the corresponding President may allocate unexhausted guns or officers in the presidency to boost the region's defense. Each gun or officer allocated increases the defense by one and is exhausted. Mercenaries may also be hired to increase the defense by one for every £2 spent.
                     * Regions dominated by the Company no longer use their written defense values. Instead, if attacked, the provincial office of the region (or President if vacant) may allocate unexhausted guns or officers in the presidency to the defense and may hire mercenaries as with a region within a Presidency (above).
                     * If the Conquest strength is greater, the target region becomes dominated by the acting region and takes the acting region's Trade Status.
                     * This may cause a region to move from one presidency into another or make a region closed, which disrupts any orders on it.
                     * If the sovereign of an empire is conquered, all regions previously dominated by that empire become sovereign and closed.
                     * When Conquest is successful and if further events remain to be resolved this game turn, the Elephant will next move to the lowest-numbered sovereign region (not including this region).
                     * If a region dominated by the Company is conquered, place a black disk on the provincial office's current officeholder.  This office will be eliminated at the end of Attrition.
                     * If a presidency's last region becomes closed, place a black disk on that presidency's current officeholder. The office will be eliminated at the end of Attrition. If seven or more regions are now closed the game may end.
                 * *Flip* Turn the region card over.
                     * If flipped to depressed, any completed orders are disrupted. Additionally, the Balance of India tilts towards chaos.
                     * If the region was flipped to prosperous, the Balance of India tilts towards order.
                 * *Revolt* The region becomes sovereign and closed.
                     * Any completed orders are disrupted.
                     * If a region dominated by the Company revolts, place a black disk on that provincial office's current officeholder. This office will be eliminated.
                     * Revolts can be canceled in Company-dominated regions if the provincial office can equal the result of the event die roll that triggered the Revolt (per the region card) with the strength of its Police, which starts at zero and increases by one for each gun or officer it exhausts from the presidency and each £2 it spends. Orders are not disrupted nor does the Balance of India tilt.
                     * If a presidency loses its last region, the corresponding presidency is eliminated (see Dissolution of Presidency). The Balance of India tilts towards chaos, and, if further events remain to be resolved this game turn, the Elephant will now move to the lowest-numbered dominated region if possible.
                 * *Collapse* Any completed orders are disrupted. The Balance of India tilts towards chaos.
                 * *Status Quo* The Balance of India tilts towards order.
                 * *Disrupted Orders* Whenever a region becomes closed, any orders on it are disrupted.
                     * The President (or former President if vacant) associated with the order immediately removes as many ships as the demand of each filled order (if possible) from either the Presidency's holdings or those ships it has exhausted, and returns them to the stock.
                     * Ships without captains must be removed before those with captains.
