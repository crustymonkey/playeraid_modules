        * Place the fauna board.
        * Give a player board to each player, making sure each player is using
          the front of their board.
        * Create a supply for sprouts, soil tokens, and trunk/canopy growth
          tokens.
        * Shuffle all the Earth cards and place them in a face down draw pile.
        * Shuffle all the fauna cards and place 1 on each of the 4 fauna
          spaces on the fauna board with either side face up. Return any
          remaining fauna cards to the box.
        * **For an advanced game**, deal out 2 island, 2 climate, and 2
          ecosystem cards to choose from (1 of each).  Otherwise:
            * Shuffle the ecosystem cards and place 1 on each of the 2
              ecosystem spaces on the fauna board with either side face up.
                * After that, deal 1 ecosystem card to each player.
                * Remaining ecosystem cards can be returned to the box.
            * Shuffle the Climate cards and deal 1 to each player. Return the
              remaining cards to the box.
            * Shuffle the island cards and deal 1 to each player.  All remaining
              cards can be returned to the box.
        * Randomly choose a start player and give them the 1st player token.
        * Each player now selects a side of their island, climate, and
          ecosystem cards.
        * Each player takes 5 leaf tokens of 1 color, placing 4 of them on
          the central leaf spaces on their player board.  Set the 5th aside to
          be used for tracking action selection each turn.
        * Each player draws a number of Earth cards shown on their island card.
            * Everyone simultaneously selects a number of cards to compost,
              as shown on their island card.
        * Each player takes a number of soil tokens equal to what is shown
          on their island card.

        The game is played over a number of rounds until, at the end of the
        round, a player has completed their island by placing their 16th
        card (4x4 grid).

        On your turn, you will choose any 1 of the 4 action spaces at the
        top of your player board, marking your choice with the leaf token
        that was set aside.

        * You may choose the same action as another player.
        * You may perform the same action multiple turns in a row.
