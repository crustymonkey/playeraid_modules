      The official suggestion is to use the instructions in the web app
      available at
      [freelancersgame.com](https://https://www.freelancersgame.com/).

      * Place the location book with room for it to be opened.
      * **Do not** shuffle the story card deck!  Place them near the location
        book.
      * Shuffle the treasure cards and place them in a stack near the location
        book.
      * Shuffle the follower cards and place them face down near the location
        book.
      * Place all the luck, stress, lock, and corruption tokens near the
        location book.
      * Each player:
          * Selects a character standee and collects its matching
            influence marker and species sheet.
          * Takes a job sheet so they can combine it with their
            species sheet to create their character sheet.
          * Should give their character a name, answers the question
            about their character, and fills out the story blanks section.
          * Retrieves their starting weapon card and places it in their
            weapon slot at the bottom of their character sheet. (There is
            a matching species illustration on the back of the card)
      * Assign all 7 [roles/responsibilities](#roles) to the players.  If
        playing with less than 7 players, some players will have multiple.
  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The app will direct you to turn to a page in the location book. When
      you have turned to the page, play will take place over a round
      consisting of [3 phases](#phases).

      ### Winning and Losing ###
      There are 3 ways the game can end.

      * **Party too wounded**: If enough wound tokens have been removed from
        the wound track on the medic board (revealing the game over space),
        all players lose and enter the code on the medic board.
      * **Party disbands**: If the threat dial ever reaches the game over
        space, the party disbands and everyone loses.  Enter the code listed
        on the lookout board.
      * **Quest goal reached**: If an entry states that players have
        completed the quest, the game is over. The more experience each
        player gained during the game, the better their personal ending
        will be.  Each player should read their personal ending out loud.
        The player with the most titles should write their character's name
        on the pipes.

      ### Saving the Game ###
      Players will have opportunities during the game to save it.

      * Players need to fill out the saved game information on the back of
        their species sheet.
      * A player will have to fill out the saved game information on the
        back of the map sheet.
      * When you want to return, open the app and follow the instructions
        listed there.

          ## Planning Phase ##
          * This is triggered when you turn to a new page in the location
            book.
          * The round timer is started immediately.
          * Players take turns placing their standees on an action space
            in influence order (highest to lowest).
          * If the timer runs out before the last player has placed
            their standee, choose 1 player to gain 1 stress and then
            continue selecting actions until all players have picked
            an action.
              * Note that players should *not* spend time reading the
                entire action and should just place based on the
                action's symbol.

          ### Actions ###

          | Symbol | Action |
          | ------ | ------ |
          | ![unlimited](/static/img/freelancers/unlimited.png) | Any number of players may place their standee on these actions. |
          | ![limited](/static/img/freelancers/limited.png) | Only 1 player may choose this action. |
          | ![locked](/static/img/freelancers/locked.png) | Locked actions cannot be chosen. |
          | ![required](/static/img/freelancers/required.png) | Required actions **must** be chosen by exactly 1 player.  If 1 or more required actions are still available before the last player(s) have chosen an action, those players **must** choose a required action. |

          ## Action Phase ##
          Each player will resolve their chosen action during this phase.

          * Actions are resolved in numerical order.
          * If there are multiple people on an action, they are resolved in
            influence order.
          * Follow the action's instructions to resolve it.
          * After resolving the action, the player should take their standee
            back.

          ## End of Round Phase ##
          * Enter the number listed under the current page's Round End
            section in the app and follow the instructions in the app.
          * When turning to a new page:
              * Remove all tokens from the current location.
              * Once you have the new page open, do **not** pause to review
                it, but instead immediately start a new Planning phase
                (start the timer and select actions).
          * If instructed to "begin a new round on this page", immediately
            go into a new round without removing any tokens.
      - name: Skill Checks
        text: |
          Do the following when prompted to make a skill check.

          1. Take the d20 and the bonus die indicated by your current level
             (no bonus die if you have no points in that skill) for the
             skill you are checking.
          2. Roll the dice and add their values.
          3. Add any modifiers you have for that skill (usually on treasure,
             story, and follower cards).
          4. Check the text for the skill check and resolve the option
             for your total.

          The following tokens affect your skill checks:

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![corruption](/static/img/freelancers/corruption.png) | **Corruption tokens**: If you have 1 or more corruption tokens, do **not** roll your bonus die when making a skill check.  After resolving that skill check, discard 1 corruption token. |
          | ![luck](/static/img/freelancers/luck.png) | **Luck tokens**: After rolling a die, or dice, for a skill check, you may discard a luck token to reroll 1 die. This can be done multiple times on a single skill check. |
          | ![help](/static/img/freelancers/stress.png) | **Help from a friend**: After rolling a die, or dice, for a skill check, you may request aid from other players.  Any other player may gain 1 stress to allow you to reroll 1 die. Players may do this multiple times for the same skill check. |
      - name: Spending Time
        id: sp_time
        text: |
          When the game instructs you to spend 1 time, the scout must draw
          a random token from the time bag and resolve it according to the
          following.

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![risk1](/static/img/freelancers/risk1.png) | Add the token to the risk track. If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
          | ![risk2](/static/img/freelancers/risk2.png) | Add the token to the risk track, then draw and resolve another token (the ⊕ symbol indicates this).  If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
          | ![wound](/static/img/freelancers/wound.png) | This is treated as a risk token and added to 1 of the risk tracks. If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
          | ![follower](/static/img/freelancers/follower.png) | Enter the code on the back of the token into the app. |
          | ![supplies](/static/img/freelancers/supplies.png) | When supplies are gained, they are added to the bag.  When drawn, they are added back to the supply (not the bag) and no other effect happens. |
          | ![threat](/static/img/freelancers/threat.png) | Resolve the effect indicated on the token. |

          ### Threat Tokens ###

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![threat1](/static/img/freelancers/threat1.png) | All players lose 1 luck token, then remove this threat token from the bag. |
          | ![threat2](/static/img/freelancers/threat2.png) | All players gain 1 corruption, then remove this threat token from the bag. |
          | ![threat3](/static/img/freelancers/threat3.png) | Treat this as a risk token that can be added to either risk track. |
          | ![threat4](/static/img/freelancers/threat4.png) | Treat this as a risk token as described above. |
          | ![threat5](/static/img/freelancers/threat5.png) | Treat this as a risk token as described above. |

          When you are instructed to reduce risk, the player may choose a
          token on either risk track and return it to the bag.
  - name: Traveling on the Map
    text: |
      When instructed to travel on the map, do the following:

      1. Players decide where they will go next by selecting a path that
         connects their current location to a new location.
      2. [Spend 1 time](#sp_time).
      3. The cartographer crosses out the party's current location, draws
         a line to the next location and circles the new location.
      4. The game master then taps the location button on the app that
         matches the new location.  Follow the instructions in the app.

      ### Backtracking ###

      * The party may select a path they've previously traveled to an
        already visited location.
      * [Spend 1 time](#sp_time)
      * Do **not** visit that location again! Instead, the party **must**
        continue traveling to another space.
  - name: Resolving Other Game Effects
    text: |
      ### HP, Stress, & Wounds ###
      * When a player gains stress, they take that from the supply and cover
        an available heart on their character sheet.
          * A player cannot willingly gain stress if they have no open hearts.
      * When a player gains a wound, the wound is removed from the wound
        track and placed over a heart on their character sheet.
          * If all the player's hearts are covered, add the wound to the
            time bag instead.
      * When a player is instructed to heal a HP, the player discards either
        a wound (back to the wound track) or stress token (back to the
        supply).

      ### Gaining Skill Points ###
      * When a player gains a skill point, that player fills in the left-most
        unfilled box in the skill row on their player sheet and gains any
        rewards that were on that space (XP or gold).
          * If all the boxes are already filled for that skill, the player
            gains nothing.

      ### Gaining XP ###
      * When a player gains XP, the player filles in the next star (top to
        bottom) on their level track.  If the star has a game effect, the
        player immediately resolves that effect.

      ### Gaining Titles ###
      * When instructed, the player writes a gained title on their player
        sheet in the titles section and circles the type of title it is
        (lawful or chaotic).
      * When a player gains their 4th or 8th title, they also gain 1 XP.

      ### Gaining/Losing Influence ###
      * The influence track is adjusted by the influencer to reflect the
        new influence when players gain/lose influence.
          * Influence markers never share a space or have empty spaces
            between them.
          * If a player at the top of the track gains influence, they may
            instead discard 1 corruption.

      ### Gaining/Losing Luck ###
      * When a player gains luck, they take 1 token from the supply.
      * When a player loses luck, they return 1 token to the supply.
      * A luck token can be discarded to reroll 1 die.

      ### Gaining/Losing Corruption ###
      * When a player gains/loses corruption, they take/discard from/to the
        supply.
      * When you have a corruption token, you cannot roll the bonus die for
        skill checks.  After performing a skill check with only the d20,
        you discard 1 corruption token.

      ### Gaining/Losing Followers ###
      * When a player gains a follower, they draw a card from the followers
        deck and slot it into 1 of their follower slots at the bottom of
        their character sheet.
          * The scout then adds the matching follower token to the time bag.
          * If both follower slots are filled, they may discard 1 of their
            existing followers to gain the new follower. Do **not** remove
            this discarded follower token from the time bag.
      * When a player loses a follower, they discard the follower card, but
        leave the token in the time bag (if it's still in there).

      ### Breaking Ties ###
      * If there is ever a tie between 2 players, break the tie in influence
        order.
      * If there is a group decision and the group can't agree, take the
        decision to a vote and the player with the highest influence breaks
        any ties.
  - name: Treasure Cards
    text: |
      * When a player gains a treasure, they draw a card from the deck.
      * If a player loses a treasure, they discard it.
      * Some cards have a **Discard** keyword, in which you discard the
        treasure to activate the effect.
          * This cannot be activated while resolving another effect (skill
            check, spending time, gain/spend resources).
          * The discard effect is only activated when a player chooses to
            discard the card, not when instructed to discard the card.
      * If the treasure deck ever runs out of cards, shuffle the discard
        to make a new deck.
      * Treasure can be traded between players when they are at a trading
        post on the map. **Treasure cannot be traded at any other time**.
          * If an armor card is traded to another player, any stress/wounds
            stay on the card.
          * When a weapon is traded, any augments stay attached to that
            weapon.

      ### Trinkets ###
      * Each player has 2 trinket slots. When gaining a trinket, they
        equip it to one of their slots.
          * If both slots are full, an equipped trinket can be discarded
            to make room for the new trinket.
      * Most trinkets grant skill modifiers, which are added to skill checks.

      ### Armor ###
      * Each player has 1 armor slot. When gaining armor, it is equipped
        to the armor slot.
          * If the slot is full, the equipped armor can be discarded
            to make room for the new armor.
      * Some armor provides an extra HP slot that can be used for wounds or
        stress.
          * If an armor card with a wound/stress on it is discarded, the
            wound/stress token is returned to its appropriate place.

      ### Weapons ###
      * Each player has 1 weapon slot. When gaining a weapon, it is equipped
        to the weapon slot.
          * If the slot is full, the equipped weapon can be discarded
            to make room for the new weapon.
      * Sometimes the game will instruct you to make a weapon check. This
        is a type of skill check that is resolved with the bonus die
        specified on the weapon.
          * If you need to make a weapon check and have no weapon, only roll
            the d20.
      * Some weapons have a trait icon below their name. This only has an
        effect when instructed by the app.
      * **Weapon Augments**: When a player gains an augment, they may either
        attach to their weapon or discard it with no effect.
          * If you gain an augment and have no weapon, you may slot it into
            your weapons slot. If a weapon is later gained, it is attached
            to the augment(s) in the slot.
          * There is no limit to the number of augments you can have.
          * An augment can be discarded for its discard effect, but when
            it is attached to a weapon it **cannot** be discarded for its
            effect.
          * If you discard a weapon with augments, the augments are also
            discarded.
