          4. Choose who will be [Caesar]!red! and [Pompey]!blue! and each player
             takes the influence tokens of their color and puts them in their
             bag.
          5. Each player secretly draws 2 tokens from their bag and places them
             behind their screen.
          6. Each player also takes their control markers and places them on
             their side of the board.

          Caesar takes the 1st turn followed by alternating turns. On your turn:

          1. Place an influence token on a free border space on the map with
             a matching icon.  Orient it whichever way you choose such that
             the line on the token lines up with the border.
          2. If all the border spaces are occupied around 1+ province(s), the
             provinces are closed and the following happens:
              1. The player who placed the last influence token takes
                 the province bonus token from **all** provinces just closed.
              2. Add up the value of each player's influence tokens and
                 whoever has the most influence takes control.  They place
                 one of their control markers on in the now empty province
                 space. **If there is a tie**, no one takes control of the
                 province.
              3. If the province is Italia, the controlling player places a
                 2nd control marker on the 2nd space (dashed line circle).
              4. If 1+ adjacent provinces are controlled by the same player,
                 an additional control marker is placed on the border spaces
                 between these provinces, covering any tokens there (usually
                 influence).
              5. The player who placed the influence token and took the bonus
                 token can now resolve the bonus.
          3. Draw a new influence token from your bag.

          The game ends immediately when a player places their last control
          marker on the map or under a senate token.  That player wins.

                ### Setup
                1. Mix the 3 poison province bonus tokens with the rest of the
                   bonus tokens, then randomly remove 3 bonus tokens from play
                   and setup the map as usual.
                2. Players start the game with **3** tokens behind their
                   screen.

                ### Gameplay
                * Play as usual.
                * When someone gains a poison bonus token, their opponent
                  randomly chooses one of their tokens behind their screen
                  and returns it to their bag.
                    * Both players can see the token before putting it in
                      their bag.
                * If a player starts their turn with no tokens behind their
                  screen, they immediately lose.

                   place them face down next to the board.

                  choose to place 1 of their influence tokens face down. If
                  they do, they immediately draw 1 of the set aside bonus
                  tokens and resolve it. **The face down token that was
                  placed counts for 0 influence**.
