          The game is played over a number of rounds, where the dealer
          alternates each round.  Randomly choose a dealer for the 1st
          round.  The dealer does the following each round:

          1. Shuffle the 33 game cards.
          2. Deal 13 cards to each player
          3. Set aside the remaining 7 cards as a draw deck
          4. Flip the top card of the draw deck face up.  This is known as the
             *Decree Card*.

                * **Leading**:  The **non-dealer leads the 1st trick.  After
                  that, the winner of the trick will lead the next trick.
                  The leader can lead any card.
                * **Following**:  The non-lead player that must (if possible)
                  match the led suit.  If the follower does not have a card
                  in the led suit, they can play any card.
                * **Determining the winner of the trick**:  After both
                  cards are played, a winner is determined.  Usually, the
                  highest card in the led suit wins.  However the *Decree
                  card* suit is considered the trump suit, and **higher
                  than other cards of different suits**.
                    * The winner takes the trick.  The number of tricks won
                      is public info.  However, **no one can look at the
                      cards in the previously won tricks**.
                    * The winner leads the next trick.

                All odd numbered cards have special abilities, which
                trigger when the card is played.  See the card text for
                how each card works.

            text: |
                The number of tricks won determines the points that each
                person scores.

                | Tricks | Points | Description |
                | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
                | 0-3 | 6 | Humble |
                | 4 | 1 | Defeated |
                | 5 | 2 | Defeated |
                | 6 | 3 | Defeated |
                | 7-9 | 6 | Victorious |
                | 10-13 | 0 | Greedy |

                After the end of round scoring, **if either player has at
                least 21 points, the game is over**.  Otherwise, keep playing
                rounds.

          The game ends when someone has 21 points after the end of round
          scoring.  The most points wins.  If there's a tie, the player
          that scored the most points in the last round wins.

          **Game Length Variants**
          * Play to 16 points for a shorter game.
          * Play to 35 points for a longer game.
    - name: Common Questions

          * **When do the abilities on the 3 and 5 occur?**
              * Both of these abilities take place immediately when played.
                Specifically, this is **before another card is played or
                the trick winner is determined**.
          * **If my opponent leads a 9, do I have to follow the 9's suit or
            the trump suit?**
              * You must follow the 9's suit if you can.  A non-trump 9 is
                not treated as if it were in the trump suit until after
                both cards have been played.
          * **Who wins the trick with two 9 cards in it?**
              * The witches abilities cancel each other out.  If the 9 of the
                trump suit was played, it wins.  Otherwise, the 9 of the lead
                suit wins.
          * **Who leads the next trick after a trick with two 1 cards in it?**
              * If both players play a 1, the player who loses the trick leads
                the next trick.
