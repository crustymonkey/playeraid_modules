              Mandates are resolved in clockwise order, starting from the player to the left of the current player.
              Each Mandate offers one ability to all players, and one bonus ability only to the current player and their Ally.

              ## Recruit

              **same type** (bushi for bushi, monster for monster, etc). If you have an Alliance, break it and lose Honor.

              Players secretly bid Coins on the different War Advantages. Going from left to right, the player who

              **Battle Outcome**: The player with the most Force in the Province wins the Battle, killing all losing
              players' figures (unless they belong to their Ally).

              **Imperial Poets**: Gain 1 VP for *every* figure killed (includes *all* killed figures, not just your own).

              Losers discard the Coins they used. Winner distributes the Coins they used equally among the losers as reparations.

      - name: Bonsai Clan
        text: |
          **Sacred Bounty** - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai Clan needs to spend very few Coins when acquiring resources.

          The cost of everything they buy, be it a Season card or a Stronghold, is limited to 1 Coin at the most. If
          it costed 2 or more Coins, it costs them 1 Coin. If it costed zero Coins, it remains free.

          In case the Bonsai player benefits from a discount, such as the *Train* Mandate Bonus, it applies after
          the clan ability, bringing the cost to zero.
      - name: Dragonfly Clan
        text: |
          **Gossamer Wings** - The Dragonfly Clan can literally fly all over the map, showing up anywhere without the normal
          restrictions faced by other Clans.

          When the Dragonfly player Summons one of their figures, it can be placed in any Province, whether they have a
          Stronghold there or not. The number of figures they can Summon with a *Recruit* Mandate is still tied to the
          number of Strongholds they have on the Map.

          When the Dragonfly player Moves one of their figures, it can be placed in any Province on the Map, no matter
          how far. Figures belonging to the Dragonfly Clan never have to use Shipping Routes to Move from one Province to another.
      - name: Fox Clan (KS exclusive)
        text: |
          **Wily Presence** - At the start of the War Phase, the Fox player may place a Bushi in each Province where they have no force.
      - name: Koi Clan
        text: |
          **Eddies in the Stream** - Ever adaptable and unpredictable, the Koi Clan is able to use Coins as if they were Ronin.
          At the start of the War Phase, the Koi player must discard all Ronin tokens they have and take the same number of
          Coins from the common pile.

          When resolving the Hire Ronin step of a Battle, all Coins the Koi player has in their reserve count as Ronin tokens,
          adding their Force to the figures in the Province if the Koi player won the *Hire Ronin* War Advantage.
      - name: Lotus Clan
        text: |
          **Dictate the flow** - The Lotus Clan determines the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play
          into anything they wish.

          On their Mandate Turns, the Lotus player selects one of the 4 Political Mandates they drew and places it facedown
          on the board, without any of the players seeing what it is. The Lotus player then announces what Political Mandate
          will be executed, choosing anything they want (IRecruit, Marshal, Train, Harvest, *or* Betray*).
      - name: Moon Clan (Dynasty Invasion Expansion)
        text: |
          **Brutality** - The Moon Clan is a shady adversary, imbued with a powerful and myseterious force that makes them
          much stronger than any other Clan.

          All figures belonging to the Moon Clan count as 2 Force, at the very least.  If they acquire an Enhancement that
          adds more Force to a given figure, it adds on top of the base 2 Force.  Likewise, if they acquire a Monster (Lucky
          God) with a Force higher than 2, then that number overrides the Moon ability.

          However, unlike other Clans, the Moon Clan is limited in the number of figures they can have in any given place.
          There may never be more than 2 Moon Clan figures in a single Province.  They also cannot have more than 2 figures
          distributed among all 4 of the Shrine tiles.

          Moon Clan cannot acquire normal Monster cards.  Lucky God monster cards are only available to Moon Clan and Sun Clan.
      - name: Sun Clan (Dynasty Invasion Expansion)
        text: |
          **Enlightenment** - Basking in the warm glow of Honor, the Sun Clan defies any opponent to challenge them in a
          contest of Honor, draining those who prove unworthy.

          Whenever the Sun Clan wins a dispute that is tied and needs to be decided by comparing Honor, they gain 1 Coin
          and 1 VP, while the tied opponent loses 1 Coin and 1 VP (if they have any). This may happen when they win by Honor
          the following situations:

            * Tied in Force in a Province during a Harvest Mandate.
            * Tied in Force in a Shrine during a Kami Turn.
            * Tied in Force in a Province during War.
            * Tied in Coins for a War Advantage during a Battle.
            * Tied in VPs at the end of the game.
            * When playing with the *Kami Unbound* expansion, the Sun ability may take place when they steal control of
            a Kami card, but not each time they prevent that control from being stolen by another player.

          Sun Clan cannot acquire normal Monster cards.  Lucky God monster cards are only available to Moon Clan and Sun Clan.
      - name: Turtle Clan
        text: |
          **Shell of the Eternal ** - The Turtle Clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary
          turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the Map and even join in the disputes for the Provinces.

          When the Turtle player Moves their figures, they can choose to Move their Strongholds as well, exactly as if they
          were Clan figures. Each Turtle Clan Stronghold also counts as 1 Force in the Province they occupy, exactly as if
          they were Clan figures.

          This may influence both Harvest and War. However, Strongholds may never be killed, never be Taken Hostage, and
          never be replaced by a *Betray* Mandate.

    sections:
      - name: Amaterasu
        text: |
          Goddess of the sun, Amaterasu allows her top worshipper to move their Clan marker straight to the top slot on the Honor Track.
          It doesn't matter how low their Honor was, they climb directly to the topmost position, shifting all others down in the process.
          
          *IMPORTANT: Note that this may change the Honor tiebreaker when resolving the following Shrines in this Kami Turn.*
      - name: Fujin
        text: | 
          God of the wind, Fujin allows his top worshipper to perform up to 2 Moves with their figures on the Map. The player may
          either Move 2 of their figures to adjacent Provinces, or Move 1 of their figures twice in a row. Just like in a 
          *Marshal* Mandate, the figure may either cross a Border or use a Shipping Route between Provinces. 
      - name: Hachiman
        text: |
          God of war, Hachiman grants his top worshipper 2 Ronin tokens, taken from the common pile.
      - name: Raijin
        text: |
          God of thunder, Raijin allows his top worshipper to Summon 1 Bushi, taking it from their Reserve and placing it in any
          Province on the Map, even if they don't have a Stronghold there.           
      - name: Ryujin
        text: |
          God of the sea, Ryujin allows his top worshipper to acquire a Season card from those available next to the board, paying
          its full Coin cost just like in a *Train* Mandate.
      - name: Susanoo 
        text: |
          God of the storms, Susanoo grants his top worshipper a number of Victory Points equal to the number of Strongholds they
          currently have on the Map.
      - name: Tsukuyomi 
        text: |
          God of the moon, Tsukuyomi grants his top worshipper 2 Coins, taken from the common pile.

      **Bonuses**: If an ability increases the rewards gained by another action, they are
      considered part of the rewards gained by that action.

      **Daimyo**: Daimyo figures (and those that count as Daimyo) are immune to any
      special effects that target a specific figure (Fire Dragon, Earth Dragon, Benten),
      but not immune to general effects that target a player (Oni of Plagues, Susanoo,
      Raijin, Path of the Serpent, etc.).

      **Honor**: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor
      wins. If there's ever a conflict in the timing of the execution of an ability,
      the involved player with higher Honor decides whether to go first or last.

      **Mandate**: All events of a Mandate are considered to happen in a single moment.
      During a Harvest Mandate, if you gain multiple Coins or VPs from different
      Provinces, it is considered a single instance of gaining those rewards for triggering
      abilities. Effects that take place at the end of a Mandate only occur after all
      players have executed that Mandate.

      **Negotiation**: During the Tea Ceremony and Political Phase, players may give each other
      Coins and Ronin tokens as part of their negotiations. Deals are never binding.

      **Place**: When you "place" a figure, you simply take it from your Reserve and place
      it on the board. This does not trigger any Summon effects.

      **Start of Battle**: The Start of a Battle is right before players prepare to allocate
      their Coins for its War Advantages.  Start of Battle effects do not end a battle even
      if they remove all figures of an opponent.

      **Start of War**: The Start of War phase happens once between the end of the Mandate Phase and before any battles
      have been fought.

      **Summon**: No matter how many different figures you Summon onto the board in
      one instance (during a Recruit Mandate, for example), it is considered a single
      Summon for triggering abilities.

      **Winning a Battle**: If a figure has a special ability that triggers off of winning a
      Battle with that figure (Oni of Souls, Piety, Kitsune), it doesn't need to still be alive
      and in the Battle at the end of it in order to activate its ability. It just needs to be
      in the Battle at some point of it.

              **A**. No, it only works when you spend Coins purchasing a Season card or Stronghold.
              It doesn't trigger off of giving Coins in War Reparation, or having Coins charged/
              taken by other effects.

              **Q**. Do I get this card's ability for reaching Winter with an Alliance?
              
              **A**. No, this only grants points for having an Alliance in Spring, Summer, and Autumn.
              It doesn't matter whether those Alliances lasted until the end of the season or not.
          - name: Komainu
            text: |
              **Q**. Does the Komainu also count as a Shinto for the purpose of Betrayal?

              **A**. Yes, for all intents and purposes the Komainu counts as both a Monster and
              a Shinto. So it can replace Monsters or Shinto during a Betray Mandate, or
              likewise be replaced by them while on the Map.
          - name: Loyalty
            text: |
              **Q**. If I have an Ally, and during a Harvest Mandate I gain 1VP from a Province and
              2VP for another, how many extra VP does Loyalty grant me?
              
              **A**. All those VP were gained at the same moment, so you only get 1 extra VP.
          - name: Loyalty and Righteousness
            text: |
              **Q**. If I have an Ally, and during a Battle I Seppuku 2 figures (2VP, plus another
              2VP from Righteousness), and then I win Imperial Poets (5 VP), how many extra VP
              does Loyalty grant me?
              
              **A**. The resolution of each War Advantage is a separate event, so those were two
              separate instances of gaining VP. You gain 1 extra VP during Seppuku and 1 extra
              VP during Imperial Poets.
          - name: Path of the Serpent
            text: |
              **Q**. How often can I charge a player for using the same Shipping Route?

              **A**. You may charge them once per instance when they use that Route (regardless
              of how many figures they move through that Route at that time). For example, once
              during a Marshal Mandate, then again when they use Fujin's Kami ability, then
              again during another Marshal...
          - name: Way of the Merchant

              **Q**. If a richer player plays a Harvest Mandate, gaining 1 base Coin, then 2 Coins
              from a Province, and 1 Coin from another Province, how many Coins does Way of
              the Merchant grant me?

              **A**. All those Coins the richer player got were gained at the same moment, so you
              only get 1 Coin.

              **Q**. Can I use Betray to replace a Daikaiju that is in the ocean with one of my
              Monsters in reserve?

              **A**. No, while in the ocean the Daikaiju is not considered to be on the Map.
          - name: Earth Dragon
            text: |
              **Q**. If a player has Path of the Serpent, can they charge so the Earth Dragon may
              move a figure out of its Province through a Shipping Route?

              **A**. Yes. If the player controlling the Earth Dragon chooses to move an opponent's
              figure out of its Province through a Shipping Route, the player with Path of the
              Serpent may choose to charge 1 Coin from the player whose figure is being
              pushed out. The player must pay if they have the Coin, but if the player has no
              Coins, then the figure can't be pushed via the Shipping Route.

              **Q**. Does the Oni of Plagues prevent figures from being pushed into its
              Province by the Earth Dragon?

              **A**. Yes, if the figure being pushed out belongs to a player with higher
              Honor than the Oni of Plagues player, it cannot be pushed into the Oni of
              Plague's Province.

              **Q**. Since he counts as a Stronghold, can Fukurokuju be killed?

              **A**. No, Strongholds cannot be killed as a basic rule (except that the Daikaiju can
              destroy them).
