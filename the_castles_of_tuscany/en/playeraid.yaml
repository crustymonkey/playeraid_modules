          Play area setup:
          
          1. Assemble the scoring board and place it.
          2. Shuffle the region cards and place them in a stack.
          3. Shuffle the yield cards and place them in a stack.
          4. Sort the square bonus tiles and set them in piles by type.
          5. Place the 8 color bonus tiles with the "1" side face up.
          6. Place the marble, workers, and blue hexagons near the scoring
             board.
          7. Mix the neutral hex tiles (beige back) and set them face down
             in small stacks.

          Each player:

          * 1 player board.
          * Place the double-sided starting castle aside and mix the other
            21 hex tiles in their color.  Create **3 facedown stacks of 7 tiles
            each** and place them on the 3 fields (1. / 2. / 3.) at the top
            of the player board.
          * **Counters**: place the thinner marker on the **50** square of the
            inner scoring bar (red) and the thicker one on the **50** field of
            the outer scoring bar (green).
          * Set aside the 50/100 victory point marker.

          Continue setup:
          
          1. Each player draws 5 region cards.
          2. Each player draws 3 random region boards -- one of each A, B,
             and C -- place them next to each other **long edge to long edge**,
             but **the boards can't be offset by more than 1 hex up or down**.
          3. Each player places their starting castle on one of the 3 dark
             green hexes.
          4. The youngest player is the starting player and they take the
             starting player tile.
          5. All players, in turn order, beginning with the starting player,
             takes any square bonus tile and places it to the right of the 
             corresponding icon on their player board.  **Anyone who takes
             a *+1 storage space* also moves up on the green track 2 spaces**.
          6. Flip 8 of the beige hexes face up in 2 rows of 4

          * ![Draw Region Card](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/draw_region.jpg)  **Draw region card**:  Players normally draw 2 region cards, but draw 1
          extra for each bonus tile. **Does not count when playing a 
          Monastery hex**.
          * ![Hex Storage Space](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/hex_storage.jpg) **Hex Storage Space**: Place an acquired hex here.  Bonus tiles allow 
            storage of an extra hex.  When acquired, **gain 2 points on the
            green track**.
          * ![Marble Storage Space](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/marble_storage.jpg) **Marble Storage Space**: Gain +1 marble for each tile.
          * ![Worker Storage Space](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/worker_storage.jpg) **Worker Storage Space**: Gain +1 worker for each tile.
              * **Using a worker**: A worker counts as 1 of the 2 required
                cards when placing hex tiles on your board.  If you use 2
                workers, you can play a hex without cards.
          * ![Draw Yield Cards](/static/img/the_castles_of_tuscany/draw_yield.jpg) **Draw Yield Cards**: Draw +1 yield card for each tile.

                You perform 1 of 3 actions on your turn.

                * Draw Region Cards:

                    * Take 1 of the face up hex tiles and place it on a
                      storage space.  If you don't have an open space, you
                      can discard a tile to the box.
                    * After taking a tile, replace the missing tile with one
                      from your own stack.  **You must take the top tile from
                      the left-most stack**.
                    * If this was the last tile of the stack, **the player 
                      must announce this**.
                        * Play until everyone has completed a turn (right of
                          the start player).
                        * Proceed to the scoring phase.
                    * **Note**: If your tile is the 5th tile of the same color:
                        * The 5 tiles of the same color are removed and placed
                          face up next to the beige tile in a stack. **These are
                          no longer available**.
                        * Draw 5 new tiles from the face down beige stacks to
                          replace the discarded tiles.
                        * Repeat as necessary until there are not 5 tiles of
                          the same color.
                * Place a Tile:
                    * Discard 2 region cards matching the color of the tile
                      to be placed.
                        * You can sub 2 same color cards for 1 card of another
                          color.
                    * The tile **must be connected to a previously placed hex**.
                    * The tile **must match the color of the space on the region
                      board**. (orange tile on an orange hex zone)
                    * **Hex tile scoring**: Check for a completed color zone and
                      score on the green track.
                        * 1 VP for a 1 hex zone
                        * 3 VP for a 2 hex zone
                        * 6 VP for a 3 hex zone
                    * **Color bonus scoring tiles**:
                        * When all zones of a color have been covered, they
                          gain victory points on the green track for what is
                          shown on the bonus tile.
                        * If the VP number showing is 1, flip the tile.  If
                          the number showing is a 2, put it back in the box.
