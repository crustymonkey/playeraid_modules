          * Variable map setup:
              1. Randomly place the terrain tiles face up inside the frame.
              2. Randomly place the harbor tiles on top of each harbor on the
                 frame.
              3. Sort the number tokens by letter.
              4. Starting at an island corner, place the number tokens in
                 alphabetic order counter-clockwise around the outer edge and
                 proceeding inward.  You can also do a fully random setup by
                 randomly placing the number tokens.
          * Each player takes 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads in their
            color.
          * Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and place them face up by the
            board.
          * Shuffle the development cards and place them face down by the
            board.
          * Place the 2 special cards (Longest Road and Largest Army) and
            dice near the board.
          * Place the robber in the desert.
          * Each player will place 2 settlements and 2 roads:
              1. Each player rolls both dice and the highest roll starts.
              2. The starting player places a settlement on an unoccupied
                 intersection with a road adjacent to it.
              3. Continue clockwise with each player doing this, following
                 the distance rule (you cannot build a settlement 1
                 intersection from another settlement).
              4. Now, starting with the last player, repeat steps 1-3 until
                 all players have placed a 2nd settlement and road in
                 *counter-clockwise* order this time (again, following the
                 distance rule).
              5. After placing the 2nd settlement, each player will take 1
                 resource for each hex connected to the intersection where
                 the 2nd settlement was placed.

          Each turn is broken down into 3 high-level steps.

          - name: "1. Resource Production"
            id: production
            text: |
                * Roll both dice and the sum of the dice determines which
                  hexes will produce.
                    * Each player with a settlement on an intersection that
                      that has a hex marked with a matching number tile takes
                      1 resource card of the hex type.
                    * **If the robber is on a hex, that hex does not produce
                      resources**.
                    * If you have more than 1 settlement bordering that hex,
                      take 1 resource for *each* settlement.
                    * Take 2 resource cards for each of your cities bordering
                      a matching hex.
                    * If there are not enough of a given resource in the
                      supply to fulfill everyone's production, **no one
                      receives any of that resource that round** unless only
                      1 player is affected.
                * **If a "7" is rolled**: This will activate the robber instead
                  of producing resources (there is no "7" number token).
                    * Every player with more than 7 resource cards must discard
                      half (rounded down) of their resources.
                    * The player who rolled the "7": 
                        1. Moves the robber onto the number token of any
                           other hex or the desert. 
                        2. Steal 1 **random** resource card from an opponent
                           of your choice with settlement/city attached to
                           the hex where the robber was placed.
          - name: "2. Trade"
            text: |
                After production is complete, you may freely trade in 1 of
                2 fashions.

                1. **Domestic Trade**: You can trade resource cards with any
                   of the other players.  Other players are allowed to make
                   proposals and counteroffers, but **trading can only be done
                   with the player whose turn it is**.
                2. **Maritime Trade**: You have the following options for
                   trades with the "bank":
                    * You can always trade 4:1.  4 identical resources in
                      exchange for 1 other resource.
                    * If you have a settlement on a harbor, those will allow
                      for 3:1 or 2:1 ratios for the resource shown.
          - name: "3. Build"

                * **Roads** (brick and lumber):
                    * A new road must always connect to 1 of your existing
                      roads.
                    * Only 1 road can be built on a given path.
                    * The 1st player to build a continuous road of at least
                      5 segments takes the Longest Road (worth 2 points)
                      card.
                    * If another player creates a **longer** road, they
                      take the Longest Road from the player that currently
                      has it.
                * **Settlement** (brick, lumber, wool, & grain):
                    * Distance rule: You may only build a settlement at least
                      2 intersections away from an existing settlement.
                    * The settlement must connect to 1 of your roads.
                    * Each settlement is worth 1 point.
                * **City** (3 ore & 2 grain):
                    * Cities are only created by upgrading an existing
                      settlement.
                    * When upgrading a settlement, replace the settlement with
                      a city and put the settlement back in your supply.
                    * Each city is worth 2 points.
                * **Buying a Development Card** (ore, wool, & grain):
                    * When buying a dev. card, draw the top card of the deck.
                    * Development cards can be played at any time during the
                      active player's turn. However, **you cannot play a card
                      that you purchased this turn**.
                    * **Knights** (purple frame):
                        * When played, you **must** immediately move the
                          robber. Seeing the "7 is rolled" part of the
                          [resource production](#production) phase.
                        * Keep your knight face up in front of you after
                          playing it.
                        * The 1st player to have 3 knights in front of them
                          takes the Largest Army card (worth 2 points).
                        * If another player later has more Knights than the
                          player currently holding the Largest Army card,
                          they take the Largest Army card.
