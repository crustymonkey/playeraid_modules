      The game takes place over a number of rounds until all sectors in the
      [hibernation](#hibernation) comb (dependent on the number of players)
      are filled with hibernation tokens *OR* when a player places their
      7th hibernation token.  This triggers the end of the game.

      Turns consist of players either [placing](#placing) workers or
      [retrieving](#retrieving) all of their workers.
    sections:
      - name: Placing Workers
        id: placing
        text: |
          * You can only choose to place a worker if you have a worker
            in your active pool.
          * Place a worker from your active pool on an action space, using
            the leftmost or topmost space if there are 2.
              * Note that many actions care about the worker strength.
              * You **must** use all or part of the selected action. i.e. you
                cannot place a worker and do nothing.
                  * Some actions have a cost to obtain something, so you must
                    be able to pay the cost for at least 1 item.
              * Action spaces are never blocked.  If there is a worker there,
                you "bump" it (see below) back to its owner.
                  * Workers can be bumped by any player, including players
                    bumping their own workers.
              * The Explore and Advance actions have more than 1 action space.
                Workers placed on those actions must be placed on an action
                space with an arrow.
                  * If there was a worker already in the space, move it to the
                    right or down 1 space.  If there's already a worker in
                    the rightmost/bottom space, bump it back to the owner.

          ### Worker Bumping
          * Workers are bumped off of single action spaces or rightmost/bottom
            spaces of actions with multiple spaces.
          * When bumped, the workers are returned to their owners with 1 of
            2 effects:
              * **Strength 1-3**: The owner has a choice:
                  * Increase the worker's strength by 1 and place it in their
                    active pool. (Place this worker again later).
                  * Retain the worker's current strength and place it in the
                    **landing area**. (Collect income with this worker when
                    doing a retrieve turn).
              * **Strength 4**: The worker must immediately
                [hibernate](#hibernation).  Discard the worker to the
                general supply and place a hibernation token.
      - name: Retrieving Workers
        id: retrieving
        text: |
          * You must have at least 1 worker to retrieve (on the board or in
            your landing area) to take a retrieve turn.
          * You must collect **all** workers (from the board and landing area)
            when taking a retrieve turn.
          * For each retrieved worker:
              * **Strength 1-3**: Collect income from a **different** farm
                tile for each worker you retrieve, then increase each worker's
                strength by 1 and return it to your active pool.
              * **Strength 4**: The worker must immediately
                [hibernate](#hibernation).

        sections:
          - name: Explore
            text: |
              1. Sum the total strength of all workers on the explore action
                 and move the queen ship orthogonally up to 1 space per
                 worker strength.
                  * The queen ship **must** end up on a different planet from
                    where it started.
              2. If there is an explore token on the destination planet:
                  1. Gain the token and its benefit.
                  2. Place the planet tile on the top of the stack onto the
                     planet (underneath the queen).
              3. Place 1 basic resource token (pollen, fiber, or water) of
                 your choice *from the supply* onto 1 empty dotted outline
                 on the planet (if any). Note that this is done whether or
                 not the planet is newly explored.
              4. Gain resources from the supply as depicted on the planet.
                 This includes printed resources and resource tokens on the
                 planet. Note that this is done whether or not the planet is
                 newly explored.

              **Strength 4 benefit**: If you placed a strength 4 worker **and**
              the queen's destination is a planet with a strength 4 benefit,
              you may gain that benefit in addition to the resources the
              planet produces (in any order).
          - name: Advance
            text: |
              Note that this is a single action for 1-3 players, but is
              treated as 2 separate actions at 4-5 players. See [tile
              types](#ttypes) for more information on tiles.

              1. Sum the total strength of both workers on the advance action,
                 adding 1 if the bottom space is empty. This determines which
                 tiles can be taken as indicated at the top of each column
                 of exposed tiles.
                  * In a 4-5 player game, each pair of action spaces is its
                    own action (for total strength).
              2. Pay the resource cost shown on the bottom of the tile you
                 are purchasing.
              3. Build the tile on an empty hex in your hive adjacent to any
                 existing tile (including your faction tile).
                  * If there is a benefit on the hex you covered, take that
                    benefit.
                  * Once a tile is built, **it cannot be moved**.
              4. Gain the tile's benefit if it is a development tile (farm
                 and recruit tile abilities are gained later).
                  * Printed victory points are gained at the end of the game.
              5. Slide all remaining tiles in the row to the left to fill
                 the gap, then draw a new tile to fill the rightmost space.
                  * This is always done at the end of your turn unless
                    specifically stated otherwise.

              **Strength 4 benefit**: If you placed a strength 4 worker, gain
              3 VP in addition to the tile.
          - name: Grow
            text: |
              Gain a combination of benefits depending on your worker's
              strength and the resources spent. You may choose either or
              both actions, and more than once with enough strength. The
              strength of your worker acts as "points" you can spend, (but
              do not decrease the strength of the placed worker).

              * Gain a strength-1 worker by spending 1 pollen and 1
                strength add it to your active pool.
              * Gain a frame by spending 2 basic resources (pollen, fiber,
                or water) and 2 strength to add it to your hive.
                  * The frame can be placed in any orientation, but must
                    have at least 1 hex adjacent to a hex on your hive mat
                    or another frame.
                  * You cannot overlap another tile or hex.
                  * The 1st 2 frames you place unlock 1 location on your
                    hive mat to plant 1 seed card via the research action.
                  * Completing a frame by building 4 tiles on it will give
                    you 8 VP at the end of the game.

              **Strength 4 benefit**: If you placed a strength 4 worker, you
              may upgrade your faction tile in addition to the above actions.
              Flip the faction tile over (showing the upgraded side) and
              place it back in its starting location.  Transfer any resource
              tokens to the new side of the tile.
          - name: Research
            text: |
              Draw a number of seed cards equal to your worker's strength,
              select 1 to keep in hand, and discard the rest.

              **Strength 4 benefit**: If you placed a strength 4 worker, after
              you draw the 4 seed cards and select 1, you may tuck 1 seed
              card from your hand under your hive mat in a seed card slot to
              gain its end game scoring benefit. Do **not** gain the 1-time
              benefit.

              * Note that slots 3 and 4 are only available after placing your
                1st and 2nd frames, respectively.
              * You cannot return tucked seed cards to your hand, cover them
                with another seed card, or discard them (unless an ability
                specifically states otherwise).
              * All end game scoring bonuses on seed cards only count your
                resources or items in your hive.

              ### Seed Cards
              * They may be kept public or private.
              * A seed card may be used on the turn gained.
              * Before or after your action on any of your turns, you may
                play any number of seed cards (discard) to do **1** of the
                following:
                  * Gain each played card's 1-time benefit (top of the card).
                  * Gain any 1 basic resource (pollen, fiber, or water) per
                    card played.
          - name: Convert
            text: |
              Perform a number of the below coversions based on the strength
              of the placed worker.

              * Discard 1 seed card from your hand (do not gain any benefit)
                to draw 1 seed card.
              * Pay 1 basic resource (pollen, fiber, or water) to gain 1
                basic resource of your choice.
              * Pay 1 pollen and 1 fiber to gain 1 wax.
              * Pay 2 pollen and 1 water to gain 1 honey.
              * Use any dance that was already taught.

              **Strength 4 benefit**: If you placed a strength 4 worker and
              have not taught a dance this game, you may teach a dance
              following these steps:

              1. Choose a dance that has not been taught and place your 3rd
                 player token on the empty square on the far right of one
                 dance row.
                  * Every time an *opponent* uses a dance, its teacher gains
                    1 [queen's favor](#qfavor).
              2. Select the required number of dance tokens (1 or 2) by
                 looking through the stack of dance tiles to fill the open
                 spots.
              3. Place the tokens in their in their respective spot(s).
                  * Once taught, dances cannot be modified.
              4. The dance is immediately available for use as you continue
                 resolving the core convert action (i.e. you can use this
                 as 1 of your conversions).
          - name: Carve
            text: |
              * You may only place a strength 4 worker on the carve action.
              * When you take the action, pay the honey cost on the desired
                tile and gain that tile.
                  * Place the gained tile in your hive adjacent to an
                    existing tile.  If you cover an icon, gain that benefit.
                  * **Do not replace a carve tile when 1 is gained!**
  - name: End Game and Scoring
    text: |
      The game end is triggered when one of these 2 things happen:

      * All sectors of the hibernation comb (for the player count) are filled
        with hibernation tokens.
      * A single player places their 7th hibernation token.

      When the end game is triggered, each player takes 1 additional turn,
      *including the player who triggered the game end*.

      ### Scoring
      Add your points gained during the game with the following:

      * Meeting the conditions on any tucked seed cards.
      * Any farms (1 VP each) plus variable points shown on recruits and
        development tiles built in your hive.
      * Meeting the conditions on any carvings you built.
      * Your position on the [queen's favor](#qfavor) track.
      * Filling your hive mat: 8 points + 8 points for each filled frame.
      * Your faction's endgame ability.
      * Winning hibernation comb sector majorities.
          * Each sector provides points for most tokens, and sometimes for
            the 2nd most tokens as well.
          * If multiple people are tied for 1st, they divide all the points
            for that sector, rounded down. No 2nd place is awarded.
          * If multiple people are tied for 2nd, they divide the 2nd place
            points for that sector, rounded down.

      The player with the most points wins.  If there is a tie, the player
      with the most active workers (on the board or docking mat) wins. If
      still tied, the victory is shared.

    text: |
      When a 4 strength worker would increase its strength (bumped or
      retrieved), it instead must hibernate.

      1. If the worker was to perform an action, they do that 1st at their
         strength of 4.
      2. The worker is returned to the general supply next to the board.
      3. Place a hibernation token onto an empty spot in the hibernation
         comb and gain the shown benefit.
          * Note that each sector of the comb offers an end game scoring
            benefit for having the most tokens in it.
          * Some pods allow you to refresh a tile row in the advance action.
            If taking this, you **must** discard **all** tiles in the
            indicated row before refilling.
  - name: Resources
    text: |
      * There are 5 resources in the game: fiber, pollen, water, wax, and honey.
          * **Basic resources**: fiber, pollen, and water.
          * **Valuable resources**: wax and honey
      * Resources are always gained and payed to the general supply unless
        otherwise stated.
      * Some resource icons show multiple resources.  Pay/gain 1 of the
        indicated resources.  Do **not** gain multiple resources.
      * Resource storage capacity is limited by spaces in your hive.
          * Gained resources are stored at the end of your turn on spaces in
            your hive (1 resource per space).
          * Resources can be rearranged in your hive during your turn.
          * **You must discard any resources that do not fit in your hive at
            the end of your turn!**  Each resource discarded in this way
            allows you to gain 1 [queen's favor](#qfavor).

      When building tiles on your hive mat, you must always build adjacent to
      an existing tile (including your faction and starting tiles).

      | Tile | Description |
      | ---- | ----------- |
      | ![faction](/static/img/apiary/t_faction.png) | Your faction tile is composed of 3 hexes.  It does not count as a farm, recruit, development, or carving tile for any purpose unless otherwise stated. |
      | ![recruit](/static/img/apiary/t_recruit.png) | Recruits provide ongoing abilities. Some trigger when performing an action (double arrow). Others trigger based on situations that arise.  All recruits cost pollen. |
      | ![dev](/static/img/apiary/t_dev.png) | Developments provide 1-time benefits for you to gain when you build the tile.  All developments cost wax. |
      | ![carving](/static/img/apiary/t_carve.png) | Carvings provide endgame scoring bonuses. All carvings cost honey. |
      | ![farm](/static/img/apiary/t_farm.png) | Farms provide additional storage spots for resource tokens. Each farm also has an income benefit that can be gained once per retrieve turn (1 farm's income benefit per retrieved worker).  All farms cost fiber and/or water. |
  - name: Queen's Favor Track
    id: qfavor
    text: |
      * At the end of your turn, you must discard any resources that do not
        fit in your hive. Gain 1 queen's favor for each discarded.
          * You may **not** voluntarily discard resources to gain queen's
            favor. You may inefficiently arrange resources to discard more
            resources though.
          * Any resources in your hive at the end of the game are not discarded
            and do **not** provide queen's favor.
      * You may share a space on the track with other players.
      * There is an endgame scoring bonus based on your final position on the
        the track.

         of the table.
          * Deal a number of faction tiles equal to the number of players + 1.
          * Deal a number of hive mats equal number of players.
      2. Starting with the last player in turn order, each player drafts a
         hive mat or faction tile.
      3. Repeat step 2, but start with the 1st player (snake draft).
