          * Place the supply board in the center of the table.
          * Stack the green areas on the designated spaces.  See the table
            below for quantities.
          * Select the appropriate animal houses. See the table below for
            quantities.  These are also printed on the supply board.
              * Stack the tiles on their designated spaces sorted from
                lowest (bottom) to highest (top).
          * Place the enclosures on the designated spaces -- always use all
            tiles, regardless of player count.
          * Lay out the bear statues next to the game board in numerical order.
            See the table below for which tiles to use based on player count.
          * Shuffle the 12 park areas without an entrance and place them in
            2 piles of 6 tiles near the board. Only the top park area in each
            pile should be visible.
          * Give each player a random park area with an entrance. Each player
            should place it so the entrance is closest to themselves.
          * Choose a starting player.
              * The start player gets a toilet.
              * The 2nd player gets a playground.
              * The 3rd player gets a playground.
                  * **If it is a 3 player game**, the 3rd player instead gets
                    a food street.
              * The 4th player gets a food street.
          * If playing with achievements (expert variant):
              * Choose 3 of the 10 types of achievements.
              * Place the 3 tiles of each chosen type in separate piles with
                the highest value on the top of each pile and the lowest value
                on the bottom.
              * **If playing with 2 players**, remove the lowest value tile
                from each stack.

          Players continuously take turns until the game ends.  The game
          ends when a player completes all of their 4 park areas, at which
          point each **other** player gets 1 more turn.

          Each turn consists of 3 steps.
      sections:
          - name: "1. Place a Tile"
            id: place_tile
            text: |
                You **must** place **1** (and only 1) tile from your supply in
                your park.

                * If you cannot place a tile, you must [pass](#passing).
                * The tile **must** fit within the marked spaces in your park.
                * You **cannot** cover the pit.
                * The tile **cannot** hang over the edge of your park.
                * The tile **cannot** overlap another tile.
                * You may rotate or flip the tile as you wish.
                * The tile must be **orthogonally** adjacent to another
                  previously placed tile.
                    * **The 1st tile placed may be placed anywhere**.
          - name: "2. Evaluate Icons"
            text: |
                Now, evaluate the icons you covered on that turn.

                * If you covered more than 1 icon, carry them out in any order.
                * **There is no limit to the number of tiles you can have in
                  your supply**.
                * A player may only have a **max of 4 park areas**. If you
                  cover your 4th construction crew, you do not take another
                  park area.

                ### Green Wheelbarrow
                ![wheelbarrow](/static/img/barenpark/wheelbarrow.png) Take a
                green area of your choice (toilet, playground, food street,
                or river). If a pile runs out, you cannot take any more of that
                tile.

                ### White Cement Truck
                ![cement truck](/static/img/barenpark/cement.png) Take the top
                animal house from a pile of your choice (polar bears, gobi
                bears, koalas, or pandas). Alternatively, you may take a green
                area of your choice instead.

                ### Orange Excavator
                ![excavator](/static/img/barenpark/excavator.png) Take an
                enclosure of your choice. Alternatively, you may take a green
                area or animal house of your choice instead.

                ### Construction Crew
                ![crew](/static/img/barenpark/crew.png) Take the top park area
                from 1 of the 2 piles.  If 1 pile is empty, you must take
                the top of the available stack.

                **Immediately** add the new park area to your park using
                the following rules:

                * The new park area must be orthognally adjacent to another
                  park area and the edges must fully align.
                * All icons in the park area must be in the correct alignment.
                  i.e. right side up.
                * You may **not** place the board below the entrance. i.e. it
                  may not be closer to you than the entrance to your park.
          - name: "3. Place a Bear Statue"
            text: |
                If you have completed a park area (covered all spaces except
                the pit), take the bear statue with the highest value and
                place it on the pit of the just completed park area.

                If you complete more than 1 park area on the same turn, repeat
                this for each area.
          - name: "4. Claim an Achievement (expert variant)"
            text: |
                If you meet the requirements of 1 or more achievements, claim
                the top tile from said pile.

                * **You can only ever claim 1 tile from each pile**.
          - name: Passing
            id: passing
            text: |
                * If you cannot place any tiles from your supply during the
                  [place tile](#place_tile) phase, you must pass.
                * Take a free green area of your choice (toilet, playground,
                  food street, or river).
                    * Your turn ends immediately after taking your free
                      green tile.
                    * **You can only place the free tile on your next turn!**
                * **You may not pass if you can place a tile**.
    - name: Game End and Scoring
      text: |
          The game ends after a player has completed all 4 of their park areas
          and each **other** player has had 1 more turn.

          Add up all all the values of the tiles in your park. If playing with
          achievements (expert variant), add those points to your total.
          The player with the most points wins.

          In case of a tie:

          1. Tied players count up the number of points on tiles in their
             supply (not placed) and the player with the highest total wins.
          2. If still tied, the players share the victory.
