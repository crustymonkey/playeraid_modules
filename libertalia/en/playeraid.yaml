          * Place the board on the table on either the calm or stormy side.
              * Optionally, you can use the tiles to randomize loot rewards
                on either side (*Uncharted* mode).
              * **Note that some tokens are only used with the Automa**.
          * Put all the loot tokens in the bag.
          * Each player takes a set of cards, score dial (set to 0), and a
            graveyard tile in their matching color
          * Mix all 6 reputation tokens (regardless of player count) and
            place them randomly on the reputation track.
          * **2 players**:
              * Cover the 2nd and 3rd spaces of the island with the Midshipman
                tile.
              * Randomly place the active players' reputation tokens on the
                3rd and 4th places of the reputation track.

          * Randomly draw loot tokens from the bag to place in the "day" spaces
            on the board equal to the number of players in the game.
              * Only use the days corresponding to your current voyage.
                  * **Voyage 1**: 4 days.
                  * **Voyage 2**: 5 days.
                  * **Voyage 3**: 6 days.
              * **2 players**:  Place 3 loot tokens on the day spaces.
          * 1 player is designated as the randomizer or [use the randomizer
            available here](/libertalia_random).
              * Only that person shuffles their deck.
              * Then, they draw 6 cards from their randomized deck.
              * Everyone else removes the same 6 cards.
              * Add the chosen cards to each player's respective hands
          * Each player gains coins equal to the number shown below their
            reputation tokens.

          The game is played over the course of 3 voyages, with each voyage
          getting longer by 1 day (see table).

          * Whenever you gain or lose doubloons, only use coins (not your
            score dial).  **The score dial is only changed at the end of a
            voyage**.
          * Whenever you are instructed to discard 1 of your char. cards,
            place it face down on your graveyard tile.

          | Voyage | Days |
          | -----  | ---- |
          | 1 | 4 |
          | 2 | 5 |
          | 3 | 6 |

          * Each day, all players simultaneously select a card from their hand
            and play it face down.
          * When all players have selected their cards, reveal all cards.
          * Place all revealed cards in ascending numerical order from left
            to right.  Ties are broken by the reputation track (highest rep.
            placed to the right).
          * Proceed to the phases below:

          ## Phases
          1. **Daytime** ![daytime](/static/img/libertalia/daytime.png):
             Starting with the leftmost char. and proceeding to the right,
             activate any chars. with a daytime ability.
          2. **Dusk** ![dusk](/static/img/libertalia/dusk.png):
             Starting with the rightmost char. and proceeding to the left,
             each player with a char. does the following:
              1. Gain a loot token from the current day.
              2. If your char. or the token have dusk abilities, resolve them
                 now.
              3. If your char. is still on the island, place it in your ship.
              4. If any loot tokens remain, put them in the bag.
          3. **Night** ![night](/static/img/libertalia/night.png):
             All players simultaneously active all night abilities on chars in
             their ship.

          - name: Reputation
            text: |
                * Reputation is a tie-breaker for any ties in the game.
                * When you gain reputation, move your token that many spaces
                  to the right and slide any other tokens to the left to open
                  your new slot.  The same is done when losing reputation, but
                  in the opposite direction.
                * If you lose more reputation than the track allows, lose 1
                  doubloon for each rep. you would have lost.
                * If you gain more reputation than the track allows, gain 1
                  doubloon for each rep. you would have gained.
                * The number on the space below reputation slot is the number
                  of doubloons the player will receive before a voyage.
                * All 6 spaces are always occupied, regardless of player count.
          - name: Loot Tokens and Tiles
            text: |
                * All loot tokens accumulated are **public information**.
                * If an ability would have you discard a loot token (from
                  anywhere), that token is put back in the bag.
                * Loot abilities are described on the board.
                * Loot tokens with dusk abilities are **only triggered when
                  they're first gained**, not on future dusk phases. They
                  are also not triggered if passed between players.
                * Some loot tokens have abilities that trigger at night.
                * Anchor abilities trigger at the end of the voyage.
                * Unless stated otherwise, all loot tokens are put back in
                  the bag at the end of a voyage.
          - name: 2-Player Mode
            text: |
                * The Midshipman is placed so it covers slot 2 and 3 on the
                  island.
                * Players place their characters respective of the Midshipman.
                * If only 1 player has a char. ranked <= 20, place it directly
                  to the left of the Midshipman.
                * At dusk, if your character is directly to the left of the
                  Midshipman, your opponent removes a loot token from the
                  current day **before you gain a loot token**.
                * The Midshipman counts as a character, but can never be
                  discarded or gain/give anything.

          After the night phase of the final day, do the following:

          1. **Anchor abilities** ![anchor](/static/img/libertalia/anchor.png):
             Activate all anchor abilities on loot tokens and chars. in your
             ship in any order.  **You cannot "game" the order of operations
             to avoid temporarily having fewer than 0 doubloons**.
          2. **Score dials**: Increase your score dial by your number of
             doubloons. Then, discard all your doubloons.
          3. **Discard look tokens and chars. in ships**: Unless noted on a
             char. or loot tile, put all loot tokens back in the bag and all
             char. cards in your ship into your graveyard.  **Keep all
             remaining cards in your hand though!**
          4. After the 1st and 2nd voyage, go to the [setup steps for the next
             voyage](#before_voyage).  [The game ends after the 3rd
             voyage](#end_game).

          * After the end of the 3rd voyage, the player with the highest score
            dial wins.
          * If there is a tie, the player with the highest reputation wins.
