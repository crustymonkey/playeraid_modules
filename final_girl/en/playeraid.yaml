        ## Core box

        * Choose a killer and a location from among the feature films. Remove
          the killer and location boards (box covers) and any associated
          components.
        * Choose a final girl to play as.
        * Take the player board from the core box and place it, choosing a
          difficulty (different sides). Place your final girl card below the
          player board.
        * Set the dice near your player board.
        * Take the action cards from the core box, setting the 6 zero cost
          cards aside (your starting hand).
        * Sort the rest of the action cards by their type and create a market
          tableau, with each card of a particular type in a stack.
        * Set the victim/special victim meeples aside along with their holding
          boards.
        * Remove the other meeples/tokens from the core box for use.

        ## Feature film

        * Place the chosen killer board above the player board.
        * Place the chosen location board to the right of the killer board.
        * Shuffle the killer's finale cards and place 1 face down, matching
          up the artwork.
        * Shuffle the killer's dard power cards and place 1 face down below
          the finale card.
        * Shuffle the killer's and the location's terror cards together, then
          take 10 random cards to form the terror deck.  Set the rest aside.
        * Shuffle the location's item cards and deal out 3 files of 4 face
          down cards in their places above the location board.
        * Shuffle the location's setup cards and draw 1.
            * Setup the board as depicted on the card using the core box
              components.
            * Place the card in its place above the location board.
            * The rest of setup cards can be returned to the box.
        * Mix the 9 black final health tokens face down (+1 die face up). Then,
          **without looking at them**:
            * Place 1 on the circle on the bottom left of the killer board.
            * Place 1 on the circle on the upper left side of the player
              board.
            * Return the rest to the box (also without looking at them).
        * Place health markers int he space on the left side of the killer
          and player boards until you have an amount matching the killer's
          and final girl's health, respectively.
            * **Important**: the *total* number of health tokens should include
              the black final health token.  e.g. If the final girl has
              5 health, they should have 1 black token and 4 heart tokens.
        * Place the bloodlust marker at the bottom of the bloodlust track
          on the right side of the killer board.
        * Place the time marker on the 6 space.
        * Place the 2nd killer marker on the horror track on the player
          board. The starting horror is indicated on the killer board.
        * Shuffle the event cards and place them face down next to the location
          board.
            * Draw the top card and follow the instructions on it.
        * You can now begin the game.
