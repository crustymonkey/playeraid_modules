          1. Shuffle the *Ocean Characters* deck and place it in the bottom
             row.  Fill the 6 slots with cards from the deck.
              * *(Cold Waters)*: Separate the *Ocean Characters* into 2
                decks based on the ◯ or ◇ symbol in the lower right of the card.
                  * 5 players:  Shuffle both decks together.
                  * 4 players:  Discard 5 random cards from 1 of the decks and
                    shuffle together.
                  * 2 or 3 players:  Discard 10 random cards from 1 deck and
                    shuffle together.
              * *(Coral Reefs)*: Separate the *Ocean Characters* into 2
                decks based on the ◯ or ◇ symbol in the lower right of the card.
                  1. Shuffle both decks separately.
                  2. Place one deck on top of the other (order doesn't matter)
                     to create the ocean characters deck.
          2. Shuffle the *Locations* deck and place it in the middle row.  Take
             6 cards from the top of the deck to fill the 6 slots.
              * *(Cold Waters)*: Change the *Locations* deck by adding
                the expansion cards and removing some based on player count:
                  * 5 players: Shuffle the expansion deck in.
                  * 4 players: Discard 2 random locations of each type (10
                    total).
                  * 3 players: Discard 4 random locations of each type (20
                    total).
                  * 2 players: Discard 6 random locations of each type (30
                    total).
          3. Place all *Wild Mantas* effect side up next to the board.
          4. Determine a 1st player.
          5. Setup either turn order mantas *(Coral Reefs)* or use King cards:
              * *(Coral Reefs)*: give the #1 turn order manta to the 1st
                player, followed by #2 to the 2nd player, and so on. These act
                like standard wild mantas. Unused mantas are returned to the
                box.
              * *Standard Setup*:
                  * If you are playing the basic game, give king card 1 to the
                    1st player, 2 to the 2nd player, and so on.
                  * If you are playing with the advanced setup,
                    shuffle as many *King* cards as players + 1 and give
                    them to the last player.  That player takes 1 and passes
                    the rest counter-clockwise.
          4. You can use the 4 printed goals or do the advanced setup (below).
             Note that goals are not used if you are using the Tribes module
             (also below).
          5. Advanced Goals Setup:
              1. Shuffle the *Goal* tokens and take 4 at random
                 and place them on the goal spots in any order.
                 counter-clockwise.
          6. Each player takes 1 of the player boards.
          7. Each player takes the colored symbol mantas of a color/symbol and
             the matching 6 starting character cards.
          8. Each player turns all their Mantas effect side up.
          9. *(Cold Waters)* / *(Coral Reefs)* Tribe Module:
              1. Place the Tribe board on top of the Ocean board so that it
                 covers the Goal Tracks. **Goals are not used with this
                 module**.
              2. Take the Tribe cards and divide them into 2 decks based on
                 their backs (I or II). *Note that you won't have to shuffle
                 or divide these if playing with just the Coral Reefs
                 expansion*.
              3. Shuffle the decks separately and draw 4 cards from each deck
                 and place them face up in their slots on the tribe board.
          10. *(Coral Reefs)* with Coral Reefs module:
              1. Shuffle the reef tokens and create a common deck based on the
                 number of players:
                  * **1-2**: 18 tokens
                  * **3**: 22 tokens
                  * **4**: 26 tokens
                  * **5**: 30 tokens
              2. Reveal 6 reef tokens and place them face up in their slots
                 below the character cards.
              3. Divide the coral into 2 piles, the supply and final reserve.
                  * The final reserve consists of 10 corals of 1 color.  Keep
                    these separate from the supply.
                  * The supply of coral is based on the number of players:
                      * **1-2**: 30 coral
                      * **3**: 40 coral
                      * **4**: 50 coral
                      * **5**: 60 coral (you will use all the coral between
                        the supply and the reserve)
              4. Each player receives a 5th +1 coin / +1 power manta. This
                 manta **cannot be used for goals or tribes**.
              5. Each player also receives 1 "Medusa Arcadio" starting
                 character card.

          On a turn, players **must** do 1 *Main action* and may also do any
          number of *additional actions*.  These can be done in any order.
      sections:
          - name: Main Action
            text: |
                * During your turn, you **must** play 1 of the character cards
                  from your hand.
                    * If you can perform all of the card's effects, **you must
                      do so**. You may still play the card if you can't use all
                      the effects.
                * After playing the character card, put it in your personal
                  discard pile (right slot above your player board) face up.
          - name: Additional Actions
            text: |
                * **Flipping Mantas**: You can use a ready manta to resolve it
                  and flip it to its used side.
                * **Exploiting Locations' Depths**:
                    * You slide the card up 1 space (left side of the card) to
                      "exploit" it and take the printed reward.
                    * **Resources**: You can only gain resources (coins and
                      power) during your main action.
                    * **Effects**: You can use these before and/or after your
                      main action.
                    * You can only exploit the top depth that is shown on a
                      location card.
                    * Empty depths are blocked until you use a *raise* effect.
          - name: Effects
            text: |
                An effect can be gained by playing a character card, using a
                Manta, or exploiting depths.

                * **Matrona**:
                    * **When playing with 2 players**, you also discard the
                      leftmost character (the free one) from the character
                      row, then refill
                        * *(Coral Reefs)*: Do **not** discard the reef token
                          below the discarded character.
                * **Recruit**:
                    1. Choose 1 character from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of coins show below the card and **put
                       it in your hand**.
                    3. *(Coral Reefs)*: Also take the reef token below the
                       character you purchased and slot it above 1 of the
                       5 location slots on your player board.
                        * You may place the token on top of another reef token
                          on your player board (the bottom ability is no longer
                          active).
                    3. Slide the other characters to the left, filling any
                       empty spaces, and turn over the top card from the
                       deck to fill the space.
                    4. *(Coral Reefs)*: Slide the other reef tokens to the
                       left, filling any empty spaces, and turn over the
                       top reef token from the deck to fill the space.
                * **Buy Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the number of coins shown at the top of the card.
                        * *(Coral Reefs)*: If buying a location in the
                          top row, receive 1 coral **to your supply**. Note
                          that this does **not** count as a seed effect.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Conquer Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of power shown at the top of the card.
                        * *(Base rules)*: Receive a 1 power discount if
                          conquering a location in the top row.
                        * *(Coral Reefs)*: If conquering a location in the
                          top row, receive 1 coral **to your supply**. Note
                          that this does **not** count as a seed effect.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Raise Location**:
                    1. Choose a location, or multiple locations (if the effect
                       is more than 1 move), and move it up the number of depths
                       specified by the effect icon.  **You do not get any
                       resources or effects from the depths you covered!**
                    2. When a location is fully risen, you receive the specified
                       wild manta if there is one on the card.  This manta
                       can be used immediately.
                * **Score** (treasure chest): This allows you to move a
                  **fully risen** location and place it in your scoring pile
                  face down.
                    * *(Coral Reefs)*: If there is coral on the location,
                      move it to your personal supply.
                * **Scout**:
                    1. Take every location from the top location row and place
                       them in the discard pile.
                    2. Move every location from the bottom row to the top row.
                       If there are more than 4 locations in the bottom row,
                       discard your choice of locations until 4 remain.
                    3. Refill the bottom row with 6 locations.
                * *(Coral Reefs)* **Seed**:
                    1. Place 1 coral on a location card located on your
                       player board.
                        * This can be placed on a fully raised location.
                        * If it is a multi-seed effect, place the corals on
                          **different** locations.
                * *(Coral Reefs)* **Defend**:
                    1. Place 1 of your mantas (exhausted or ready) in your
                       player color on a location on the main board. This
                       is known as a "defended location".
                        * This location cannot be conquered/bought by **any**
                          player (including the defender).
                        * When the defended location is to be discarded,
                          the player defending it takes it onto their
                          player board instead. *Note that this can happen
                          on other players' turns*.
                            * If the defending player's board is full, it
                              is instead discarded.
                            * The player does **not** receive a coral when
                              this happens.
                            * The manta is returned to the player in an
                              **active** state (even if the location was
                              discarded).
                        * If a goal is completed by receiving the location,
                          the goal cannot be claimed until the receiving
                          players next turn.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
          Players take turns until 1 of the 3 game end conditions are met.
          When this happens, everyone (including the player who
          triggered the game end) takes 1 more turn.  Game end
          conditions:

          *(Coral Reefs)*: If you are playing with the turn order mantas,
          finish the current round, then each player takes 1 more turn. Do
          this **instead of** the above with the Kings.

          * 1 player has accomplished all 4 goals (with mantas on
            them).
              * *(Cold Waters)* / *(Coral Reefs)*: **This is no longer an
                end game trigger if playing with the Tribes module**.
          * The location deck runs out.
          * The character deck runs out.
              * *(Coral Reefs)*: **This is no longer an end game trigger if
                playing with the Coral Reefs module**.  **Instead**, if the
                reef deck (tokens) runs out.
          * *(Coral Reefs)*: If the main supply of coral is depleted.
              * Use the reserve coral to complete the game.

          Scoring is as follows:

          * 1 point for each character card in your hand, including
                your king, but **not** counting those in your discard
                pile.
          * The number of points shown above your mantas on the
                goals track.
          * The total number of points from locations in your
                scoring pile.  Locations on your player board do **not**
                give you any points.
          * *(Coral Reefs)*: Each coral in your supply is 1 point.

          Tie breaks:

          1. The player with the most mantas in their reserve.
          2. The player with the lowest number on their king card.
          3. (if not playing with kings) The last player in turn
                 order wins.
    - name: Goals
      text: |
          If a player fulfills a goal on their turn, they can place one
          of their (their player color) mantas on the 1st available
          spot for that goal. The manta can be used or unused. **Each
          goal can only be completed once by each player**.

          This module adds Tribe cards of 2 different types:

          * Dark blue cards provide an ongoing bonus (bottom
            of the card).
          * Light blue cards provide an instant bonus (bottom
            of the card).
          * *(Coral Reefs)*:  You may use coral to recruit a tribe card in
            place of/addition to coins.

          You no longer use the Goals and instead will be
          recruiting Tribes to help you.  To get the help of
          a Tribe:

          1. Choose the Tribe to recruit.
          2. Play a Recruit Character action.
          3. Calculate the cost of the Tribe card: Base cost + 1
             coin for each Manta that has already been placed there
             by other players.
          4. Pay for the Tribe. **You can help pay for the card by
             removing Locations from your score pile and returning them
             to the box**.  If you do this, you gain an amount of coins
             equal to the amount of points on the Location card.
          5. Place 1 of your mantas on the chosen Tribe card.
          6. Get the instant bonus as applicable.
