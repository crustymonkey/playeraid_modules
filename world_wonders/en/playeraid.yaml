          * Takes their resource board (all players use the same side, either
            A or B)
          * Takes their player marker
          * Takes a set of resource markers
      * Place the player markers on the turn order track in random order.
      * Place long road tiles and sets of short road tiles (sets are two 2x1
        tiles and one 1x1 tile) below the main board based on player count:
          * **1-2 players**: 1 long road and 1 set of short roads.
          * **3 players**: 2 long roads and 1 set of short roads.
          * **4 players**: 2 long roads and 2 sets of short roads.

      * Place 1 tower alongside the road tiles.  Set the others aside for
        later use.
      * Shuffle the monument cards, reveal 3, and place their respective
        monuments on each one. Set the rest of the deck nearby.
      * Create a supply of loan tiles.
      * Each player takes a map board. All players must use the same side,
        either A or B.
      * Give each player 1 long road tile.
          * **This tile is placed during your 1st turn of the game at
            no cost along with any piece(s) purchased during that turn**.
