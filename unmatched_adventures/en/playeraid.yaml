  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over a series of rounds with players/villians/minions
      taking turns according to when their initiative cards comes up. The
      game continues until either the players defeat the villian or the
      players lose.  The players can lose by the villian achieving its
      objective or by all players being eliminated.

      ## General Rules
      * Heros and sidekicks controlled by the players are called "player
        fighters" and opposing fighters are called "enemy fighters".
      * The main enemy is called the "villian" and all other enemy fighters
        are called "minions".
      * Players are only eliminated when **all** of their fighters are
        defeated.
          * When a player is eliminated, removed their initiative card from
            the initiative row, or later when it's flipped.
          * Eliminated players are not affected by enemy attacks.
      * If a fighter reaches 0 health, they are defeated.
          * A defeated fighter cannot recover health.
      * A fighter can never go above their starting health
      * You can have more than 7 cards in your hand during your turn, but
        **you must discard down to 7 cards at the end of your turn**.

      ## The Initiative Deck
      At the start of each turn, reveal the top card of the intiative deck
      and resolve its effects.

      * Some initiative cards resolve when revealed and some have effects that
        resolve at the end of the round.
      * Resolve any **RIGHT NOW** effects immediately.  This is usually a
        player or enemy taking a turn.
      * After all the "right now" effects have been resolved, draw the next
        card from the initiative deck and place it the right of previously
        drawn cards (creating the "inititiative row").

      ## The Threat Track
      * At the end of each round, the villian advances the threat marker as
        shown on its initiative card.
      * Advance the threat marker 1 space if an enemy cannot reach and
        attack a target.
      * When the threat marker reaches the end of the track, **ignore any
        additional spaces it would move** and immediately resolve the
        objective's effect.
          * If the game doesn't end, return it to the 1st space on the track.

          On your turn, you **must** take **2** actions.  The possible actions
          are:

          * Maneuver
              1. Draw the top card of your deck and add it to your hand. **You
                 must do this!**
                  * If you cannot draw a card, **each of your fighters
                    immediately takes 2 damage** for each card you cannot draw.
              2. Move your fighters (optional).
                  * Your character card lists your move value.
                  * You may move each of your characters, 1 at a time, up to
                    your move value.
                      * **Before moving**, you may choose to boost your
                        movement by discarding 1 card from your hand to add
                        that cards boost value to your move value.
                          * Cards that would no longer be otherwise playable
                            can be used for boosting.
                      * Movement must be through adjacent spaces.
                      * You can move through friendly fighters.
                      * You must end the movement on an empty space.
                      * You **cannot** move your fighters through spaces
                        with opposing fighters.
                      * The order in which you move your fighters is up to you.
                      * You do not have to move all of your fighters.
                  * If an effect allows you to move opponent fighters, all
                    the same movement rules must be followed (from the
                    opponent's perspective).
          * Scheme (⚡)
              * Choose a scheme card (⚡) and declare which (undefeated)
                fighter is resolving it and play it face up.
              * Resolve the card's effects and place it in your discard pile.
          * Attack
              1. Declare your target
                  * Any fighter may use a melee attack on an adjacent space,
                    regardless of the zones.
                  * Ranged fighters may attack any fighter in the same zone
                    as the attacker (don't have to be adjacent).
              2. Choose and reveal
                  1. Choose an attack (or versatile) card from your hand play
                    it face down in front of you.
                      * Your attacking fighter **must** be able to use this
                        card (their name or "any" on it).
                  2. The defender **may** choose a defense (or versatile) card
                     from their hand and play it face down.  For UMA, you
                     always draw the top card of their deck and use its
                     defense.
                      * Your defender **must** be able to use this card.
                  3. Reveal both cards at the same time and resolve them in the
                     following order.
                      * **Immediately**: Resolve any of these effects 1st.
                        They will often cancel other effects.
                      * **During combat**: Resolve these next.  These will
                        often change attack/defense values.
                      * **Apply combat damage**: The attacker deals damage
                        equal to the value of their played attack card after
                        subtracting the defense value (if any) on the
                        defender's card.
                          * Note: A defender never deals damage to the
                            attacker, even if the def. value is higher.
                      * **Additional effects**: Some effects happen "after
                        attacking" and occur as the last step after the
                        attack is fully resolved.
                      * **After combat**: Resolve any of these card effects.
                        These will often move fighters or draw cards.
                      * **Cleanup**: Place all played action cards in their
                        discard piles.
                      * Other rules:
                          * **If 2 effects would ever resolve at the same time,
                            the defender's effect resolves 1st**.
                          * If a fighter is defeated during the combat, any
                            effects on their card still resolve.
                          * Card effects are mandatory unless they include the
                            word "may".
                          * If something refers to a card's "printed value",
                            that is only the value on the card with no
                            modifiers.
                          * If an effect "ignores" a card's value, the value
                            is always 0 when calculating combat damage,
                            regardless of any modifiers.
                          * Resolve as much of any effect as you can if it
                            cannot be fully resolved.
                          * If an effect is canceled, do not resolve it.
                  4. Winning the comboat.
                      * The attacker won the combat it they dealt at least
                        1 **combat** damage (other effects do not count).
                      * The defender wins if they took 0 **combat** damage.

        text: |
          Enemies will attempt to make **1** attack (not 2 turns, like players)
          on a player fighter.

          ## General Rules
          * Effects that specifically refer to "heroes" or "sidekicks" do
            **not** affect villians or minions.
          * All enemy action cards are versatile and can be used for attack
            or defense.  Note that they have separate attack and defense
            values.
          * Most of the enemy card effects are also versatile and are resolved
            when played as attack or defense.
              * If the attack and defense values are split into 2 different
                boxes, the effect only resolves when the corresponding value
                is used.
          * Enemies do not have a hand of cards.
              * If any effect would reveal (or look at) an enemy's hand,
                instead look at the top card of the enemy deck.
              * If an enemy is forced to discard cards, put that many cards
                from their deck into their discard.
          * Enemy ability tokens:
              * Generally, each space is limited to **1 ability token of
                each type**.  If a duplicate would be placed, nothing happens.
              * If there are multiple valid placement spaces, players choose.
              * If there are no tokens left in the supply to place, nothing
                happens.
              * Ability tokens are **not** fighters.  They cannot be attacked
                and effects that refer to "fighters" or "minions" do not apply
                to these.
              * The tokens can only be removed according to their specific
                rules.
          * Deception cards:
              * Each enemy has a deception card in its deck.
              * Whenever this card is placed in its discard pile, shuffle the
                discard pile back into the deck.
              * This effect **always** resolves, even when placed in the
                discard pile due to another effect.  It cannot be canceled
                or prevented.
              * If this is discarded in the middle of combat, **immediately**
                shuffle the enemy deck, but do **not** shuffle the card the
                enemy is using in combat.

          ## Taking an Enemy Turn
          An enemy will determine a target, move to reach the target (if
          necessary), then makes **1** attack on its target.

          1. Determining a target
              1. If the fighter is adjacent to 1 player fighter, it attacks
                 them. If it is adjacent to more than 1 player fighter, the
                 players choose who the enemy attacks.
              2. If the enemy can move adjacent to a player fighter in its
                 movement range, it moves to them.  Again, players decide
                 who the enemy moves to if there is a tie.
              3. If the enemy cannot move to be adjacent to a player fighter,
                 it does **not** move or attack.  Instead, **advance the
                 threat marker by 1 space**.
          2. Moving
              * The move value for the enemy is its initiative card.
              * Enemies may move through other enemy fighters.
              * Enemies always take the shortest route to a destination.
                  * If there are multiple shortest routes, the players choose
                    which route.
              * If an effect places an enemy in a specific space or has them
                swap spaces, this does not depend on the move value.
                  * When moving like this, the enemy does not move through
                    any spaces other than their destination.
                  * If there are multiple spaces to move to or enemies to
                    swap with, players choose.
                  * If all spaces the enemy could move to are occupied,
                    the enemy stays in their current space.
          3. Enemy combat
              * When an enemy resolves combat (as an attacker or defender),
                they always draw the top card of their deck after the player
                selects and plays a face down card as normal (optional for
                defense).
              * Resolve the attack value and all effects in a similar manner
                to attacks in [player turns](#player_turns).
                  * Note that some effects are "boxed" and only apply to either
                    attack or defense.
              * After the cards are resolved, add the card to the enemy's
                discard pile.
              * When an enemy is reduced to 0 health, it is defeated.  Remove
                all of its components from the game.
                  * Remove the initiative card either immediately (if face up)
                    or later when it is revealed.
      - name: Using Other Unmatched Fighters
        text: |
          * **Choosing an opponent**: Enemies are treated as being played by
            an opponent.  However, enemies cannot be "chosen".  Ignore any
            effect that says "choose an opponent".
          * **Enemy decisions**: 
      - name: End of Round
        text: |
          * After the last card from the initiative deck has been resolved and
            all fighters have taken their turns, resolve all "end of round"
            effects on the initiative cards from left to right.
          * Shuffle the initiative cards, place them face down, and start
            the next round.
      - name: End of Game
        text: |
          * Players immediately win if they defeat the villian by reducing
            his health to 0.
          * Players immediately lose if the villian achieves its objective
            4 times.
          * Players immediately lose if all players are eliminated.
