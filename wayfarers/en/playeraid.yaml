      The game is played over a number of rounds until the [end
      game](#end_game) is triggered by a player reaching 1 of the 5 final
      spaces on the journal track.

      On your turn, you will do one of the following actions:

      * Place a die
      * *Or* place a worker
      * *Or* rest
    sections:
      - name: Place a die
        text: |
          * Dice are placed onto your player board or onto die spaces on cards
            you previously acquired.
          * Only 1 die may occupy a space.
          * If the space shows asset requirements, you must have those assets
            or use abilities to gain them.
              * You may spend 1 blue influence to temporarily gain a ship
                asset for a single die placement.
              * Assets are shown in your caravan's column matching the value
                of your die (after any die manipulation).
              * Townsfolk cards will sometimes provide assets.
              * If the die space is blank, you do not need any assets.
          * When using die manipulations to change the die value, the die
            value does **not** wrap (6 to 1 or 1 to 6).
              * Die manipulations may be chained.
              * Die manipulations in your caravan do **not** stack.  e.g. if
                you have 2 "+" icons in a column, you **cannot** use them to
                add 2 to your die value.  Instead only 1 of the icons may
                be used.
          * You can use the [yellow guild](#guilds) to change the value of
            1 or 2 dice.
          * Some spaces have requirements in addition to assets. They will be
            depicted to the left of the arrow.
          * After placing a die, fulfilling all the requirements, gain the
            depicted reward (right of the arrow).
              * If you gain the "refresh 1 die" ability, you remove 1
                previously placed die from a space, roll it and return it
                to your supply (you can use it again on a later turn).
                  * You can even "refresh" the die you just placed that
                    turn.
                  * If you haven't played a die or don't wish to remove 1,
                    you can *instead* reroll 1 of the dice in your pool.
      - name: Place a Worker
        text: |
          * Basic placement rules:
              * **Only 1 green worker may be placed on each townsfolk card**.
              * **1 green and 1 yellow worker may be placed on each land card**.
              * **1 green and 1 blue worker may be placed on each water card**.
              * **1 green, 1 blue, and 1 yellow worker may be placed on each
                inspiration card**.
          * Workers are placed onto 1 of the face up cards around the edges
            of the main board (except space cards).
          * The action that is printed on the board below/above the card is
            what is resolved.
          * You may only place a worker if you are able to resolve at least
            part of the action.
              * You may **not** place a worker on a card and do nothing.
          * After placing a worker, you may not take any action that would
            cause you to retrieve that same worker in the same turn.
      - name: Resting
        text: |
          1. Determine whether abilities can be activated:
              * If you have 0 or 1 die left in your supply, you may activate all
                your resting abilities.
              * If you have 2+ dice in your supply, **no abilities may be
                activated**.
          2. Remove your dice that were placed, then roll **all** of your dice
             (including any that remained in your supply).
          3. If you are eligible, you may resolve all your resting abilities in
             any order.
              * You start with 1 resting ability, but others can be gained
                from townsfolk cards placed under water cards.
      - name: End of Turn
        text: |
          * Refresh face up cards by sliding cards to fill gaps, then flipping
            new cards face up to fill the rows.
              * Townsfolk and land cards slide to the right.
              * Space and water cards slide to the left.
              * Inspiration cards slide down.
  - name: Game End
    id: end_game
    text: |
      * The game end is triggered by a player reaching 1 of the 5 final spaces
        on the journal track.
          * After that player finishes their turn, all players take 1 last
            turn, including the player who triggered the game's ending.

      ## Scoring
      1. Score points based on **primary** (city, vista, harbour, or open
         water) tags based on the table below.
          * Remember to count tags in your caravan.
      2. Score [space cards](#lws_cards) and achieved [inspiration
         cards](#insp_cards).
          * Players should determine who has the most [comet tags](#lws_cards).
          * Remember to count tags in your caravan.
      3. Score all printed VP values on upgrade tiles in your caravan.
      4. Score guild majorities: 3 VP to the player with the most influence
         in each guild.
          * If there is a tie, no one scores any points.

      The player with the most points wins.  If tied:

      1. The player with the most black influence wins.
      2. The player with the most yellow influence wins.
      3. The player with the most blue influence wins.
      4. The players share the victory.

      This covers some specific rules for different aspects of the game.
    sections:
      - name: Guilds
        id: guilds
        text: |
          * Guild abilities (spend 1 influence to activate):
              * Black: When journaling, move 1 additional space.
              * Yellow: Increase or decrease dice by a total value of 2.
                  * This can be 2 different dice by 1 each or 1 die by a
                    difference of 2.
              * Blue: When placing a die, act as if it had a ship asset.
          * Players may only use each guild's ability at most **once per turn**.
      - name: Land/Water/Space Cards
        id: lws_cards
        text: |
          * *General note*: Your starting player board features cards
            printed on it. These "cards" act like any of the cards that
            you acquire during the game, which means that you can tuck
            other cards above/below them as normal.
              * The 1 exception to this is the observatory/library space
                on your player board (with 4 dice placement spots). This
                is **not** technically a "card" for any game elements that may
                reference them.
          * When acquiring a card with a worker(s) on it, add the worker(s)
            to your supply.
          * The benefits on cards can **never be activated on the same turn**
            they were acquired (except immediate ðŸ—² effects).
          * Land cards are placed to the left of your player board.
              * These cards have no inherent cost, but the action being
                taken to acquire them may have a cost.
                  * When acquiring 1 of these cards, you can either take
                    a face up card **or** draw 3 from the deck and keep 1
                    (return the others to the bottom of the deck).
                      * You must have an available pidgeon symbol or spend
                        1 provision to use the "deck" option.
              * Some land cards have 1-time immediate effects on the left
                side of the card (blue bar with a ðŸ—² symbol).
          * Water cards are placed to the right of your player board.
              * These cards have no inherent cost, but the action being
                taken to acquire them may have a cost.
                  * When acquiring 1 of these cards, you can either take
                    a face up card **or** draw 3 from the deck and keep 1
                    (return the others to the bottom of the deck).
                      * You must have an available pidgeon symbol or spend
                        1 provision to use the "deck" option.
              * Water cards provide immediate effects via the connection
                links on card edges.
                  * Activate anything where a benefit matches a ðŸ—² symbol.
          * Space cards must be placed above land or water cards. These provide
            victory points.
              * Space cards cost silver based on which slot they sit above.
              * They can never have an empty card slot below them.
              * There is only 1 sun and 1 moon card. They are worth 3 VP on
                their own or 14 VP if you have both.
              * There are 5 planet cards, scoring 1 VP + 1 additional VP per
                planet tag (including its own).
              * There are 8 comet cards, each worth 1-3 VP.
                  * At the end of the game, if a player has more comet tags
                    than anyone else, each comet card is **worth 4 VP each
                    instead**.
              * Some space cards have 1-time immediate effects printed on the
                right side of the card (blue bar with a ðŸ—² symbol).
      - name: Inspiration Cards
        id: insp_cards
        text: |
          * Inspiration cards do not have a cost.
          * Inspiration cards must be tucked above space cards.
              * Each space card can **only have 1 tucked inspiration
                card**.
              * If you can't tuck the card, or don't want to, it can
                **instead** be discarded for the immediate effect printed
                on the board in the slot it was removed from.
                  * Discarded cards should be placed face down at the bottom
                    of the inspiration card stack.
          * These cards will provide VP if the condition(s) on the card are
            met at the end of the game.
              * Inspiration cards will double the value of the space cards
                they are placed above (if the condition(s) is met).
      - name: Townsfolk Cards
        text: |
          * Townsfolk cards must be tucked under land or water cards.
          * When acquiring a card with a worker(s) on it, add the worker(s)
            to your supply.
          * The benefits on cards can **never be activated on the same turn**
            they were acquired (except immediate ðŸ—² effects).
          * Townsfolk cards require specific tags in order to be acquired.
              * The tags are listed to the right of the name on the card.
              * They may only be tucked under a land/water card featuring
                at least 1 of the required tags.
          * These cards enhance the cards they are tucked under or provide
            various other effects.
          * Each land/water card can **only have 1 tucked townsfolk card**.
          * Townsfolk abilities can be resolved before or after the
            land/water card's ability.
          * As depicted on your starting star card, each pair of
            townsfolk card + upgrade tile will score 1 VP at the end of
            the game.
      - name: Upgrade Tiles
        text: |
          * Upgrade tiles are placed on your caravan to upgrade it.
          * The costs for land/water/space/basic upgrade tiles are shown on
            the board near where they are kept.
          * Special upgrade tiles do not have a cost, but are acquired through
            other actions (like advancing on the journal track).
          * When placing upgrade tiles in your caravan:
              * They must fit completely into the caravan (can't hang off).
              * Tiles cannot cover other tiles.
              * Tiles can be flipped.
              * Tiles can **never be rotated**. All icons must appear
                un-rotated.
              * Tiles can never be moved or removed after being placed.
              * If you cover a space with an icon, gain the effect shown on
                the board.
          * Some upgrade tiles have VP printed on them that will score at
            the end of the game.
          * Pink upgrade tiles also feature tags, which work the same way
            as tags printed on cards.
              * Primary tags (city/vista/harbour/open water) on upgrade tiles
                also contribute toward tag scoring at the [end of the
                game](#end_game).
          * Some tiles show a silver or provision discount icon. When placing
            a die with these icons, that die's entire action is discounted
            by whatever is in the matching column.
          * Some tiles show dice manipulation symbols. These allow the die
            to be altered before placing it.
