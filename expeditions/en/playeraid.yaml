      A turn consists of either taking actions or refreshing.

      * You begin your turn by shifting your action token.
      * If you take actions, you **must perform all exposed actions** (that
        you are able to).
      * With the exception of the refresh turn and the 1st turn after a
        refresh, your action token must stay in the Move/Play/Gather box.
      * When you start your turn on the refresh action, shift your token to
        the left and take all 3 actions. On your next turn, you will shift
        the token to 1 of the Move/Play/Gather spaces and take the 2
        showing actions.
      * The game ends when someone plays their 4th star.

          * If you cannot legally move, stay where you are and count it as
            taking the move action.
          * If you move onto a face down location, **your movement ends**.
              * Gain the map token.

                location.
                  * The tokens are placed in the order drawn, with

                  * The tokens cover the right hand action space.

        text: |
          Take 1 card from your hand area (left of your mat) and
          place it to your active row (right of your mat).  If you
          already have cards there, place the new one to the right.

          * In any order, you may:
              * Gain the card's core value (upper left).
              * Place a matching worker on the card to activate its ability
                (bottom).

          ### Gain Core Value
          * Some cards have conditions based on the number of stars
            or melded meteorites.
          * When gaining power/guile, move the appropriate token on
            the track. **You may never have more than 10 of either**.

          ### Activating Abilities
          * "Cards you control" may be in either your hand or active row.
          * Any ability that refers to a token, card, worker, or mech applies
            only to items in your possession, unless explicitly stated
            otherwise.
          * Some abilities have conditions. e.g. a minimum number of melded
            meteorites.
          * Each card may only hold 1 worker.
          * Any reference to a card's color pertains to the color of worker
            printed on it.
          * "Previous" refers to the card to the left of the card in the
            active row.
          * "Face-up" cards are the cards in the board area. Adjacent face
            up cards are those adjacent to your mech.
          * **Items** (instant and ongoing)
              * Instant benefits are printed above the worker space.
              * Ongoing benefits are active while the card is in your active
                row (with a worker on it).
              * If you trigger a card with an instant and ongoing ability, you
                can resolve them in any order.
              * If there is a cost, you must pay the cost 1st.
          * "Rescue" a card by returning it to your hand from the active row.
            If it has a worker on it, return it to your mat.
          * Gained and discarded cards go to the right-most space in your
            active row.
              * Gained/discarded cards do not grant any benefit and you cannot
                play a worker on them.
              * Cards may only be discarded from your hand.
          * If the card has an "OR" clause, you may only activate 1 of the
            2 abilities.
          * "Trashing" cards returns them to box.
          * If a card activates another cards ability, do **not** place another
            worker.
              * If the activated ability has an ongoing ability, it only
                applies to the end of the current turn.
          * "Solve": Your mech must be at a location matching a quest you
            control (hand or active row).  Pay the cost shown on the right
            hand side of the card to get the benefit below the red arrow.
              * The quest is slid under the top of your mat.
              * You may only solve 4 quests during the game.
              * You may solve a quest whether or not the location has
                corruption.
              * If you gain a map token as a benefit, gain it from the supply.
          * "Vanquish":  Pay the cost of the top-most corruption token in
            your mech's location and gain the corruption token.
              * **You may repeat this to gain more than 1 corruption token
                for a single vanquish action**.
              * Removing the final corruption will reveal a new benefit that
                can be gained during a Gather action.
              * The values/colors of the corruption and the benefit space
                underneath are public info.
              * If the corruption is destroyed by some other means, return it
                to the bag.
              * Location 20 has the 20 value corruption token. It requires
                both 10 guile and 10 power to defeat it.
      - name: Gather
        text: |
          When you take a Gather action, gain the exposed benefits at your
          mech's location.

          * Each icon is a separate benefit.  If they are separated by a "/"
            ("or"), you may only choose 1 of the benefits.
          * *Gain a face up card*: You may gain any of the face up cards. If
            instead it is gaining an adjacent face up card, take one adjacent
            to your mech.
              * Immediately replace any cards taken with a new card from the
                deck.
                  * If the deck is ever empty, shuffle the discard to form
                    a new deck.
              * When you gain a card, add it to the right of your active row.
          * *Sweep*: Remove any number of face up cards and place them in
            the discard pile next to the deck. Replace any of the swept
            cards with new ones.
          * *Gain a worker*: Gain the worker from the supply and place it on
            your mat.
              * **Workers are limited in supply**.

          * *Gain a benefit from an adjacent location*: Gain only **1** of the
            benefits from an adjacent location.
          * *Activating an adjacent card's ability*: Activate a card adjacent to

            a card.
          * *Refresh cards and workers*: Return active cards to your hand and

          * *Upgrade*: Tuck an item card from your hand or active row under
            the right side of your mech mat so that the ability is showing,
            but the worker is covered.
              * Instant benefits are ignored and only ongoing abilities now
                matter for the tucked cards.
              * The ongoing ability is active for the rest of the game.
              * You are limited to 4 upgraded cards.
              * If a worker was on the card when upgraded, return it to your
                mat.
          * *Meld*: Tuck a meteorite card from your hand or active row under

                including the newly melded card.
              * You are limited to 4 melded cards.
              * If a worker was on the card, return it to your mat.

          * *Boast*: Choose 1 (and only 1) glory category on the basecamp
            board for which you've met (or exceeded) the goal and you don't
            have a star on it, and place a star on it.
              * The number of stars placed can give you additional benefits
                on other cards you play.
      - name: Refresh
        text: |
          * When you take a refresh turn, return all cards in your active row
            to your hand and all workers back to your mat.
          * Put your action token on the Refresh space on your mat.
              * On your next turn, you will move it to the space to the left
                of the refresh space and take all 3 actions.
              * After the above turn, you must move your action token to 1 of
                the Move/Play/Gather spaces.
          * If you get a refresh benefit, only return your cards and workers,
            do **not** move your action token.
  - name: End of the Game
    text: |
      The game end is triggered when a player places their 4th star on the
      basecamp. Each player takes 1 additional turn **including the player
      who placed the 4th star**.

      ## Final Scoring
      * The number of coins you have.
      * The coin value on each upgraded item (bottom right corner).
      * Each corruption scores $2, including the "20" token.
      * **Each glory token** scores an amount equal to the number of quests
        solved. e.g. each star would be worth $6 if you solved 1 quest.

      | Quests | Value |
      | ------ | ----- |
      | 0 | $5 |
      | 1 | $6 |
      | 2 | $8 |
      | 3 | $10 |

      The player with the most money wins. If there is a tie, the player with
      greater sum of all glory categories wins -- add up the total number of
      quests, melds, upgrades, etc.  This includes adding up items for
      categories without stars.  If there is still a tie, the players share
      the victory.
  - name: Mech Abilities
    text: |
      * **Tatanka**: You may solve, upgrade and meld up to **5** times each.
      * **Marsh Strider**: Your movement range is 1-4 spaces (instead of 1-3).
      * **Odin's Wrath**: You may trash a map token to gain either 1 power,
        1 guile, or $1.  This must be map tokens in your supply.
      * **Lumberjack**: Whenever you vanquish, reduce the cost of the 1st
        corruption of each color by 1. For the "20" corruption tile, this
        reduces it to 18 (9 of each).
      * **Highlander**: You may gain cards directly to your hand (instead of
        the active row).
