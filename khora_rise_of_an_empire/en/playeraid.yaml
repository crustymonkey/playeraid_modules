                Each player sets up the following.

                * One city board.
                * One city tile chosen randomly from the 7 tiles.
                * Place your economy, culture, and military tokens in the
                  level 1 spaces.
                * Place your development marker next to the bottom
                  development on your city tile.
                * Place one of your dice in the empty space below your culture
                  track.
                * Place your 7 action tiles in your color in front of you.
                * Deal each player 5 random politics cards, face down.
                    * All players draft the politics cards by taking 1 and
                      passing to left until all cards have been drafted.
                * Take 4 Drachmas.

            text: |
                * Place the central board.
                * Place the deck of politics cards near the board.
                * Place the Drachma pool near the board.
                * Place 36 Knowledge tokens on the matching space on the right
                  side of the board.  Place the Minor Knowledge tokens near
                  the board.
                * All players place their Citizen marker on level 3 of the
                  citizen track.
                * The tax, glory, and troop markers all start at level 0.
                * Create the Event card deck:
                    * Set aside the *Growing Populations* and *Conquest of
                      the Persians* cards.
                    * Place the *Conquest of the Persians* face down next to
                      the board.
                    * Shuffle the 14 remaining cards and take 7 at random and
                      place them face down on top of *Conquest of the Persians*.
                    * Put *Growing Populations* face down on top of the stack.
                * Each player places their victory point marker on the zero
                  space of the score track.  Place the victory point tiles
                  near the zero space of the score track.
                * Place the Philosophy tokens near the board.
                * All players now apply the text of their 1st (unlocked)
                  Development.  Note that some cities gain an immediate
                  benefit.  **If you move up on a track, also gain the
                  benefits from the new level**.
                * Randomly choose a start player.

          Khora is played over 9 rounds, tracked by the event deck.  Each
          round is divided into 7 phases.
      sections:
          - name: A. Event Announcement
            id: event_announce
            text: |
                The start player reveals the top card of the event deck, placing
                it face up and reading the text.  Note that **the event will be
                resolved in [F. Event Resolution](#event_resolution).

                **Exception**: The *Growing Population* event takes place
                during the [C. Dice](#dice) phase of the round it is revealed
                in.
          - name: B. Tax
            text: |
                Each player gains Drachma equal to the level of the marker on
                the tax track.

                Each of the following steps are done simultaneously.

                1. Roll all of your available dice.
                    * **The player who rolls the lowest total sum will be the
                      start player for the round**. If tied, the start player
                      is the player closest to the last start player, going
                      clockwise.
                2. Choose your actions.
                    * Each player secretly assigns 1 of their 7 action tiles
                      to each of their dice. **Each tile can only be matched
                      with 1 die**.
                3. Reveal your chosen actions.
                4. Adjust the position of your citizen marker.
                    * For each die/tile pair, if the die value is **less than**
                      the number on the tile, you must lower your citizen
                      marker by the difference between the 2 values.
                    * If you can't lose the required citizens, you **cannot
                      use that tile** this round and it must be set aside.

                Resolve all the action tiles in increasing order.  The tiles
                can be resolved simultaneously until the Military tile (#4),
                which must be done in turn order.  **All actions are optional**.

                      citizens over 15 will be reset to 15 at the end of
                      the action phase.  **There is no limit to the number

                      **You can only buy 1 Knowledge token per action**, but
                      there is no limit to the number of Knowledge tokens you
                      can have.

                      The reserves for Drachmas and Knowledge tokens are

                      **You can temporarily exceed level 15 on the Military
                      track** and explore with extra Military.  If you still
                      exceed 15 at the end of the action phase, reset the
                      marker to 15.

                      To Explore:

                      1. Choose a Knowledge token that is still available.
                      2. Your Military must be **>=** to the value of the
                         Military to the right of the Knowledge token.
                      3. Lose Military on the track equal to the skull value.
                      4. Take the Knowledge token.  Also gain any benefits
                         shown below the token's space.  **You can only
                         explore once per action to gain 1 Knowledge token**.
                           * **Exception**: *Exploring Persepolis* allows you
                             to take all the Major Knowledge tokens from
                             the board at the same time.

                      To play a Politics card:

                      1. Verify you have the token(s) required, shown in the
                         upper right of the card.  Minor or Major Knowledge
                         tokens don't matter. **Do not spend the tokens!**
                      2. Pay the required Drachma shown in the upper left of
                         the card. Note that some cards have no Drachma cost.
                      3. Place the card in front of you.
                          * Cards with a [yellow]!#bfa619! background have an
                            immediate effect. Apply its effect as much as
                            possible and leave it in front of you.
                          * Cards with a [purple]!purple! background have an
                            an ongoing effect.  Its effect remains active for
                            the rest of the game.
                          * Cards with a [red]!red! background have an end-game

                      To unlock the next development on the development track
                      of your City tile, do the following:

                      1. Verify you have the Knowledge tokens required, shown
                         just above the next development.  It doesn't matter
                         if the Knowledge tokens are Major or Minor.  **Do
                         not spend the tokens!**
                      2. Pay the required Drachma. Some developments don't have
                         a Drachma cost.
                      3. Move the development marker to the next space. The
                         effect to the right is now active, **along with every
                         effect below the marker**.  There are 3 types of
                         developments.
                           * Immediate effects (lightning bolt) are applied
                             as soon as this is unlocked.
                           * Ongoing effects (infinity) are applied for the
                             rest of the game.
                           * Final scoring effects are applied during final
                             scoring.

                In turn order, each player may choose to improve a single
                track on their city board: economy, culture, or military.  To
                improve on the track, they must pay the Drachma cost for the
                next level on that track.

                this round.

                * If an effect targets the player with the most/least military,
                  only that player applies the effect. If multiple players are
                  tied, all tied players apply the effect.
                * If the effect concerns an element other than military, all
                  players apply the effect.

                **Each Achievement can only be completed once**, and only
                during this phase of the round.  If more than one player
                achieves the same Achievement in the same round, they all
                earn that Achievement.

                If you have completed an Achievement, place 1 of your
                Achievement tokens on the matching space of the central board.
                Then, receive:

                * If you are the **only player** to complete the Achievement,
                  move up 1 space on either the tax **or** glory track.
                * If multiple players completed the Achievement, each player
                  moves up 1 space on the tax track

                Achievements can never be lost, even if you no longer meet the
                requirements later. Once an Achievement is complete, **no
                other player can earn that Achievement in later rounds**.

                If you have reached the end of round 9, go to [End of the
                Game](#end_game) or proceed to the next round with [Event
                Announcement](#event_announce).

          There are 3 different ways to use Philosophy tokens.

          * During the [C. Dice phase](#dice) (step 4, adjust the citizen
            marker), you may spend as many Philosophy tokens as you like. For
            each token spent, gain 3 citizens on the citizen track.
          * During the [Politics](#politics) or [Development[(#development)
            action during [D. Actions](#actions) phase, you may spend as many
            **pairs** of Philosophy tokens as you like. For each **pair** of
            tokens spent, you can ignore 1 Knowledge token requirement to
            play a card or unlock a development.  **Do not take these
            Knowledge tokens**.
          * During the [E. Progress](#progress) phase, you may spend as many
            Knowledge tokens as you like. For each token spent, you can move
            up one extra level on the track of your choice, but you must
            still pay the required Drachmas.
    - name: End of the Game (Final Scoring)
      id: end_game
      text: |
          The game ends after 9 rounds.

          Final Scoring (add the following):

          * Any points from end game developments.
          * Any points from end game politics cards.
          * Points equal to their glory level multiplied by the number of Major
            Knowledge tokens they possess.

          The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the player
          with the most Drachma wins. If there's still a tie, share the victory.
