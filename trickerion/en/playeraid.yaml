Replace its Symbol marker and its Academy marker in the Classroom with your own special markers. Until the end of the game, you will benefit from this Trick in the Classroom phase, but it does not occupy a slot in your Workshop. You may do this with up to 2 of your Tricks. Tricks set aside this way are ignored ruing the endgame scoring.
