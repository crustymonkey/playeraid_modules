      * Place the game board in the center of the play area and optionally
        place the 14 reference cards next to it.
      * Each player takes a cave card.
      * Set aside the 3 winter cards and shuffle the remaining cards and return
        some cards to the box based on player count:

          * 3 players: 20
          * 4 players: 10

        card on top of that same pile.

          * If none of the cards is a tree, you may take a mulligan by
            removing all 6 cards in your hand **from the game**. Then draw
            a new hand of 6 cards.

      The game is played over a number of rounds until the 3rd winter card
      is revealed, which [ends the game immediately](#end_game) (you don't
      even finish your turn).

      On your turn, you must do one of the following actions:

      * Draw 2 cards
      * **OR** Play a card and check the clearing
    sections:
      - name: Draw 2 Cards
        text: |
          * Draw 2 cards, 1 at a time, and add them to your hand.
              * For each card, you may choose to draw from the deck **or**
                take a face-up card from the board.
          * You can have a **max of 10 cards in your hand**.  i.e. if you have
            9 cards in hand, you can only draw 1 card.
          * If you draw a winter card, place it face up next to the board and
            draw a replacement card.
              * If it is the 3rd winter card, the game ends immediately and
                you proceed to [end game and final scoring](#end_game).

          * Each card has either 1 tree or 2 forest dwellers.
              * Each tree card features exactly 1 type of tree.
              * All other cards are split in half, either vertically or
                horizontally.
          * To play a card:
              * Pay the cost in cards (upper left) by placing that many cards
                face up on the board.
                  * If playing a split card, only pay for the half you are
                    going to expose.
              * Trees are played separate from other trees.
                  * **Also draw a card from the deck when playing a tree**.
                      * If you draw a winter card, set it next to the board and
                        draw another card, unless it is the 3rd winter card,
                        in which case proceed to [end game](#end_game).
                  * You may also play any card face down as a tree.
              * Forest dwellers are "attached" to a tree by sliding 1 half
                under a tree and leaving the other half exposed.
                  * Each tree can have only **1 card** on each side (left,
                    right, top, bottom).
                  * You may take any bonus or apply any effect after playing
                    1 of these cards.
                      * Some cards provide instant effects and some are
                        permanent, ongoing effects.
                      * Cards with a
                        ![binocs](/static/img/forest_shuffle/binocs.png)
                        symbol in a colored arrow provide a bonus if all cards
                        used to *pay* for the played card have the same color.
                          * With split cards as payment, it doesn't matter
                            which half shows the symbol.
          * After playing a card, check the board and if there are 10 or more
            face up cards on it, remove all the face up cards from the game.
  - name: End Game and Scoring
    id: end_game
    text: |
      The game ends **immediately** when the 3rd winter card is drawn, which
      means that whoever drew it does **not** finish their turn.

      ## Scoring
      * Total the points of all visible cards.
      * Score 1 point for each card under your cave card.
      * **Reminder**: Cards played face down as trees do not count for any
        kind of scoring.

      The player with the highest number of points wins.  If there is a tie,
      the players share the victory.

          1. Decide which of your current cards in hand you want to play via
             the effect of the Mole.
          2. Pay the combined printed cost of all cards that you want to
             play and place them in your forest, according to the normal
             rules. Keep track of which cards you pay with matching tree
             symbols (for the bonus of those cards).
          3. Finally, carry out the effects and bonuses of the played cards,
             in the order they entered play.
          4. New cards that you get from the effects and bonuses of the
             played cards are irrelevant for the Mole: you may not play
             them via the Mole nor may you use them to pay for the played cards.
          5. If you gain any additional turns from the effects and bonuses
             of the played cards, keep track of how many you gain and take
             them one after the other, after you complete this turn.

        order of played cards. Cards played via the second Mole will be
        carried out before any cards played via the first Mole that are yet
        to be carried out. When carrying out the second Mole, you can play
        and use cards drawn from effects of the cards played via the first
        Mole.  After you finish carrying out the cards played via the
        second Mole, carry on with the remaining cards played via the first
        Mole.

        contains at least 10 trees, including any tree saplings. Violet

        cave card scores 1 point.

      ## Red Deer
      (left/right, 5x, cost: 2)

      * **Bonus**: Place a deer card from your hand into your forest at no
        cost, without using the effect and bonus of that card.
      * **Points**: The Red Deer scores 1 point for each tree and plant card
        in your forest. If you have more than one Red Deer, these points
        are multiplied accordingly. (Note that tree saplings also show the
        symbol, thus increasing the value of the Red Deer.)

      ## Red Fox
      (left/right, 5x, cost: 2)

      * **Effect**: Draw a number of cards from the deck equal to the current
        number of European Hares in your forest. (Observe the hand size limit
        of 10 cards.)
      * **Points**: The Red Fox scores 2 points for each European Hare in
        your forest. If you have more than one Red Fox, these points are

        slots. Normally, a Silver Fir scores a maximum of 8 points unless

      (tree, 6x, cost: 2)

      * **Points**: The Sycamore scores 1 point for each tree card in your
        forest, including the Sycamore and any tree saplings. If you have
        more than one Sycamore in your forest, these points are multiplied
        accordingly.

      ## Tawny Owl
      (top, 4x, cost: 2)

      * **Effect**: Draw a card from the deck.
      * **Bonus**: Draw two cards from the deck (in addition to the card from
        the effect of the Tawny Owl).

      ## Tree Ferns
      (bottom, 3x, cost: 1)

      * **Effect**: Draw a card from the deck.

        card in your forest. If you have more than one
        Tree Ferns in your forest, these points are multiplied accordingly.

      ## Tree Frog
      (bottom, 3x, cost: 0)

      * **Points**: The Tree Frog scores 5 points for each Gnat in your
        forest. If you have more than one Tree Frog, these points are
        multiplied accordingly. (There are 3 Gnats in the game.)

      ## Violet Carpenter Bee
      (left/right, 4x, cost: 1)

      * **Effect**: Whenever the number of trees of a certain species is
        required, each Violet Carpenter Bee at a tree of that species
        increases that number by 1. There are only five cards for which
        the Violet Carpenter Bee is relevant at all:
          * **Beech**: Beeches do not score points unless you have at least
            4 of them. For instance, 3 Beeches and a Violet Carpenter Bee
            at one of them count as 4 Beeches. Consequently, the 3 Beeches
            score 5 points each, for a total of 15 points (see Beech). You
            do not score 5 points for the Violet Carpenter Bee, because it
            is no Beech.
          * **Horse Chestnut**: Horse Chestnuts form a set whose value depends
            on the total number of Horse Chestnuts in your forest; a Violet
            Carpenter Bee at a Horse Chestnut increases that value. For
            instance, 2 Horse Chestnuts and a Violet Carpenter Bee at each of
            them score 16 points (because you count 4 Horse Chestnuts);
            without the Violet Carpenter Bees, the set would score only 4
            points (see Horse Chestnut).
          * **Linden Trees**: Linden Trees score 3 points each (instead of 1
            point each) if you have the most; Violet Carpenter Bees can
            help you with that.
          * **Great Spotted Woodpecker** and **Moss**: The values of these
            cards depend on the total number of trees in your forest; your
            Violet Carpenter Bees increase that number.
          * In all other cases, consider this counter example: You have 3 Oaks
            and a Violet Carpenter Bee at one of them, and all eight tree
            species.  When it comes to how many Oaks you have, you would
            count 4 Oaks; regardless, you score only 3×10=30 points for
            them (see Oak), because the Violet Carpenter Bee is no Oak.
      * **Points**: The Violet Carpenter Bee scores no points.

      ## Wild Boar
      (left/right, 5x, cost: 2)

      * **Points**: Each Wild Boar in your forest scores 10 points if your
        forest contains at least 1 Squeaker. If there is no Squeaker in your
        forest, your Wild Boar score no points.

      ## Wild Strawberries
      (bottom, 3x, cost: 0)

      * **Points**: Each Wild Strawberries in your forest scores 10 points if
        your forest contains all 8 tree species: Beech, Birch, Douglas Fir,
        Horse Chestnut, Linden Tree, Oak, Silver Fir, and Sycamore. If you
        are missing at least one tree species in your forest, your Wild
        Strawberries score no points.

      ## Wolf
      (left/right, 4x, cost: 3)

      * **Effect**: Draw a number of cards from the deck equal to the
        current number of deer cards in your forest. (Observe the hand size
        limit of 10 cards.)
      * **Bonus**: Take another turn after you complete this one, again
        choosing between drawing and playing cards.
      * **Points**: The Wolf scores 5 points for each deer card in your forest.
        If you have more than 1 Wolf, these points are multiplied accordingly.

      ## Wood Ant
      (bottom, 3x, cost: 1)

      * **Points**: The Wood Ant scores 2 points for each card in the bottom
        card slot of a tree, including the Wood Ant. If you have more than
        one Wood Ant, these points are multiplied accordingly.
