          Final scoring happens after 5 rounds.  Final scoring is the sum of
          the following:

          *  ![glory](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/glory.png) **Glory**: 
              1 VP for each step on the glory track.
          *  ![basic goods](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/basic_goods.png) 
              **Basic Goods**: 1 VP for each basic good in your stock.
          *  ![processed goods](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/proc_goods.png)
              **Processed Goods**: 2 VP for each processed good in your stock.
          *  ![money](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/money.png)
              **Money**: 1 VP for every £10.  **Leftover money breaks ties in
             the final score**.
          *  ![hops](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/hops.png)
              **Hops**: 1 VP for each Hop imported, as listed on your fulfilled
             export contracts.
          *  ![import goods](/static/img/clans_of_caledonia/import_goods.png)
              **Cotton, Tobacco, and Sugar Cane**: 3, 4, 5 each according to
             their rarity.  The rarest imported good is the most valuable.
              *  The import token that was moved the furthest on the track is
                 the most common imported good and worth 3 points.  The next
                 most imported is worth 4 points, and the least imported is
                 worth 5 points.
              *  **If there is a tie for imported goods**, cotton is the rarest
                 followed by tobacco, then sugar cane.
          *  **Export Scoring**: Each player counts the number of fulfilled
             export contracts and scores as follows:
              *  **3/4 players**: 12 VP for the player with the most fulfilled
                 contracts, 6 VP for the 2nd most.
              *  **2 players**: 8 VP for the player with the most fulfilled
                 contracts.
              *  In case of a tie, evenly divide the VP of the tiers, rounded
                 down.
          *  **Settlement Scoring**: Each player counts the **number of their
             settlements within shipping reach of each other**.
              *  A settlement is a cluster of neighboring units of 1 color
                 (adjacent and **no river in between**).
              *  Single units are also considered settlements.
              *  If not all your settlements are within shipping reach of each
                 other, the **biggest** group of settlements counts in this
                 scoring.
              *  **3/4 players**: The player with the most **settlements**
                  gets 18 VP, 2nd most gets 12 VP, 3rd most gets 6 VP.
              *  **2 players**: The player with the most **settlements** gets
                  12 VP.
              *  In case of a tie, evenly divide the VP of the tiers, rounded
                 down.

                No matter how much cotton, tobacco, or sugar cane was imported,
                each is worth 4 VP at the end of the game. If you use this,

                Apply the following auction mechanism to auction clans.

                1.  Randomly draw as many clan tiles as the number of players
                    and allocate a random starting tile to each clan.
                2.  Randomly determine a player who bids any number of VP (can
                    be 0) to be able to choose a clan 1st.
                3.  The player to their left can bid any higher amount of VP
                4.  Continue until everyone passes after a bid.  30 VP is the
                    highest possible bid
                5.  The player winning the bid writes down their bid as
                    negative VP on the score sheet and places their token
                    on the first space of the turn order track and takes
                    their choice of clan/starting tiles.
                6.  The player to their left bids for 1 of the remaining clans.
                7.  Continue until the last player is given the remaining
                    clan/starting tiles at no cost.

                   2 export contracts in 1 turn, **you pay the cost only once,

                   However, during each turn in which you obtain an export
                   contract, you gain the £5.  So, you can obtain an export

                   export contract in another turn and again gain £5, even if

                   because you cannot perform the tech upgrade action.
                *  You have 3 abilities:
                    1. You can use all your workers as either woodcutters,
                       miners, or **fisherman** (even when placing the
                       1st workers).  All your workers cost £6 and provide
                       £4 income.  Fisherman can be placed on, or moved to,
                       all empty loch spaces and port bonus tiles, even in a
                       1-2 player game. There are no land costs on loch
                       placements. 2 fisherman may never be adjacent to each
                       other.
                    2. Once per turn, you can move a fisherman to an adjacent
                       loch space **by rowing**, but only before your main
                       action.
                    3. In 1-2 player games, you start with river-crossing
                       shipping for free.
                *  You still need the appropriate shipping reach to expand
                   across loch spaces.  Land spaces adjacent to fisherman
                   are considered to be neighboring and thus accessible in
                   the expand action, even without the shipping reach. The
                   neighborhood bonus can be taken advantage of when
                   deploying a fisherman as well, but **not** when rowing.

                   whisky to get this money.
                *  Furthermore, you have a cellar.  At the beginning of each
                   production phase, whisky barrels already in the cellar
                   age and are moved one spot to the right. The whisky barrel
                   starting a production phase in the rightmost space of the
                   cellar is placed into your stock. You can move any whisky
                   barrel from the cellar into your stock at any time.  When
                   you move aged whisky out of the cellar into your stock,
                   you gain £7 or £15 respectively.
                *  At the end of each production phase, you may put one
                   freshly-produced whisky barrel in the cellar on the
                   left spot so it can age in later production phases.
                *  For the purposes of scoring tile #2, whisky in the cellar
                   **does** score.

                   making a purchase, you receive the money **before**
                   paying), no matter how many units you trade.  If you
                   use the neighborhood bonus and trade multiple types of
