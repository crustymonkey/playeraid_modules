          * Each player:
              * Takes a random island board. They can place it on the
                side of their choice. Not that the 2 "*" side will be
                more difficult than the 1 "*" side.
              * Takes a metropolis tile.
              * Takes 1 orichalcum and 1 hoplite.
          * Place the actions board in the center of the table.
          * Shuffle the terrain tiles by their size and make piles near the
            central board.

          * Reveal cards from the action deck to fill the the slots
            on the action board based on player count (5 with 2-3 players, 6
            with 4 players).
              * Place a matching sized terrain tile on each action card.
                  * For each volcano symbol, draw a creature from the bag and
                    place it on the volcano.
          * Place the construction board near the action board.
              * Randomly select 4 buildings from the building bag to fill

          The game is played over a number of rounds and ends when a player
          has 5 victory points **and** their island is clear of any creatures.

          Turns are divided into 5 steps, taken in order.

          **At the start of your 1st turn**: Place your metropolis tile on
          1 of the ports on your island board, taking the rewards you are
          covering up.
      sections:
        - name: "1. Select an Action Card (mandatory)"
          text: |
              * Choose 1 available action card from the board, taking the
                card, terrain tile, and any creature on it.
                  * If a card is taken from 1 of the 4 right-most slots,
                    pay the additional cost in hoplite(s) above the card.
              * Slide all remaining cards to left to fill the open slot, if
                necessary.
        - name: "2. Place the Terrain Tile (mandatory)"
          text: |
              * Place your newly acquired terrain tile onto your island
                following these rules:
                  * The terrain tile must fit entirely into the island
                    (can't be "hanging off").
                  * It cannot be laid on top of any already occupied circle.
                  * It must be adjacent to at least 1 other terrain tile (or
                    your metropolis).
                  * If the tile cannot be placed according to the above
                    rules, the tile is placed back on the bottom of the
                    appropriate tile stack.
              * If there was a creature on a volcano space on the tile,
                the creature is placed with the tile such that it is still
                on the volcano space.
              * If a port space is covered by the terrain tile, take the
                depicted reward.
              * **Taking a Titan**: If you have created a connected area of
                3 circles of the same type, take the matching Titan tile,
                flip it to its active side if necessary, and place it in the
                left-most VP slot in their island board. (This is 1 VP)
                  * If another player has the titan, take it from them.
                  * If a player creates a 3 size area or simply expands an
                    existing area, they take the titan tile (if they don't
                    already have it).
                      * **IMPORTANT**: The Titan does **not** stay with
                        the player with the largest area.
                  * Each Titan has an ability that can be used once, at
                    which point the tile should be flipped to its inactive
                    side.
                      * The Titan is still worth 1 VP when inactive.
                  * **A player can only have 1 Titan tile at any time** (by
                    default).
                      * If a player gets a new Titan, them **must** replace
                        the previous Titan tile with the new one. The
                        previous Titan is placed in the Titan area face up.

              id: prod_orich
              text: |
                  * The player produces 1 orichalcum for each mine on their
                    island.
                  * Note that the Titan Hyperion can be used to double the

                  * The player recruits 1 hoplite for each of the training
                    camps on their island.
                  * Note that the Titan Themis can be used to double the

              id: capture
              text: |
                  * You can fight creatures, 1 after another, in the order
                    of your choosing. Follow these steps for each creature:
                      1. Target a creature.
                      2. Choose how many hoplites to add to the attack (0-3 can
                         be used in each fight).
                          * You cannot exceed 3 hoplites for any battle.
                            e.g. if there were 2 hoplites already on the
                            creature, you could only add 1 more.
                      3. Take 1 combat die + 1 additional die for each hoplite
                         in the battle. (max of 4)
                      4. Roll the combat dice.
                          * If the die total >= the creature strength **OR**
                            a skull was rolled, you defeat the creature.
                              * Return all hoplites used in the battle to the
                                general supply.
                              * Place the defeated creature in your supply
                                and take the reward shown on the creature.
                              * You may now battle an additional creature if
                                you so choose.
                          * If you failed to defeat the creature, leave the
                            hoplites there for when you fight the creature
                            again.
                              * Your creature action ends. You may **not**
                                battle another creature this turn.
                  * Note that the Titan Chronos can be used to automatically
                    win 1 fight.

                  You may construct 1 item of your choice from 3 available
                  options.

                  General rules:

                  * **You cannot construct anything on a tile adjacent to
                    a creature on your island**.
                  * When you cover a terrain, it no longer counts toward
                    the requirements for a titan, but you do not lose any
                    titan you currently have.
                  * Buildings must be constructed over existing terrain.
                    They cannot be constructed on unfilled portions of the
                    map.
                  * Only 1 building can be constructed over a terrain. i.e.
                    you cannot stack buildings.
                  * Note that the Titan Theia allows you to perform 1
                    additional construction of your choice.

                  ## Building
                  * The player picks 1 of the buildings available on the
                    construction board and constructs on their island.
                      * The building **must** be placed on the matching
                        terrain.
                      * Volcanos are wild, so any building can be placed on
                        them.
                  * If you construct a mine or training camp, take the
                    orichalcum/hoplite on the tile.

                  ## Temple
                  * A temple is constructed on 4 adjacent **different**
                    terrains.
                      * Volcanos are wild, so they can be used as anything
                        in fulfilling the 4 different terrain requirement.
                  * After constructing a temple, take a victory point tile,
                    flip it to its temple side and place it in the left-most
                    available slot at the top of your island board.

                  ## Orichalcum Medallion
                  * You may spend 5 orichalcum to "build" a VP. Take a VP
                    tile and place it in the left-most available slot at
                    the top of your island board.

              You may purchase 1, **and only 1**, additional action. The
              costs and available actions are depicted on your island board.

              * You may perform the same action you took in phase 3.
              * You may even take the action you chose not to take in phase 3.

              **Only do this in a 2 player game!**

              * The active player must choose 1 card from the action board to
                discard.
                  * The terrain tile is placed back on the bottom of its
                    matching stack.
                  * Any creature is put back in the creature bag.
        - name: End of Round
          text: |
              Once each player has taken a turn, the round ends.  Do the
              following:

              1. Replenish the action board by placing an action card on any
                 open spaces to refill the board (based on player count).
                  * If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile to
                    make a new draw pile.
                  * Add the matching terrain tiles to each card.
                  * Place a random creature from the bag on each volcano.
              2. Replenish the construction board, replacing any buildings
                 that were constructed with a new building from the
                 building bag.
                  * Remember to place 1 orichalcum on mines and 1 hoplite
                    on training camps.
              3. Assign the initiative token to the player with the most
                 hoplites. They will go 1st next round.
                  * If players are tied, the player that currently has
                    the initiative token decides who receives it for next
                    round.
                  * The player to the right of the player with the initiative
                    token takes 1 hoplite.
              4. Start a new round.
