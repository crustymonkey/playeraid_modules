                previously moved.
              * A car may be assigned a [coast](#coast) die 2 times per round.
              * If you do not have a car you can legally assign a die to,

        id: command
        text: |

                    be slammed).
                  * Any car ending its turn in a space with a chopper is
                    **eliminated**.

            turn by the value of the die you've assigned to Nitro.
              * You **must** move the full amount for your vehicle moves.
          * **Drift** (3-5): For this turn, your car may pass through the
            1st space it enters with another vehicle (no [slam](#slam)).
              * If you end your turn in a space with another vehicle, you
                still slam it, **even if it's your 1st slam that turn**.
          * **Repair** (6): Remove 1 damage token from any of your cars and

                move later this round).
      - name: "Step 3: Move"
        text: |
          * During the 1st round, the 1st movement for each car is to a space
            on the back edge of the 1st road tile.
          * Your car moves a number of spaces equal to the movement die value.
          * A car must always move into 1 of the 3 spaces in its front arc
            (the 3 spaces in the front, front left, and front right) of
            your vehicle (unless some effect changes that).
          * The following rules apply any time a car is moved, whether on your
            turn, or from a slam or damage token:
              * A car must move the full amount unless some effect changes this.
              * A car may move through a space with a chopper.
              * If a car enters a space with a face down hazard, turn it face
                up and resolve it.
              * A car loses its remaining moves when it takes damage.
              * If a car moves into a space with another car, including
                [wrecks](#wrecks), place the moving vehicle on top of the
                vehicle in the space and resolve a slam. **This ends the
                movement of the moving vehicle**.

          * The rules for shooting are:
              * You can shoot a *road* vehicle (not a chopper) in the
                front arc (the 3 spaces in the front, front left, and front
                right) of your vehicle.
              * If you have more than 1 target, choose 1.
              * You cannot shoot choppers.
              * You may shoot [wrecks](#wrecks). Like inoperable cars, if they take

              * You may shoot after resolving a slam.
              * You may shoot your own cars.
          * To shoot: Roll the shooting die and if the size portion matches
            the size of the car you are **shooting** (not your car you are
            shooting *from*), the vehicle is hit and takes damage.
              * The owner of the damaged car draws and resolves a damage token.

      * Any inoperable cars are left on the board.
      * The player takes no more turns.

        is the final tile, add the finish line after it.
      * **3+ players**: When 1 player is out of the game (above), add the
        finish line to the current end road tile.
          * If this occurs when moving off the front of the board, place the
            new lead tile, then the finish line.

    id: damage_tokens
    text: |
      | Tile | Effect |
      | ---- | ------ |
      | ![dent](/static/img/thunder_road/dent.png) | No effect (other than taking damage). |
      | ![shrapnel](/static/img/thunder_road/shrapnel.png) | Roll the direction die, and starting with the car that took damage, look in that direction in a straight line until you reach the 1st vehicle. Apply a damage token to that vehicle. Shrapnel passes through any terrain, even impassable.  If there's no vehicle in that direction, nothing happens. |
      | ![skid](/static/img/thunder_road/skid.png) | Move the damaged car 1 space in the direction shown. |
      | ![dazed](/static/img/thunder_road/dazed.png) | Roll the stunt die and move your car that many spaces, rolling the direction die for *each* space of movement (to determine direction). You are still affected by any terrain you move into. If you enter a space that causes you car to lose its moves, the dazed effect ends. |
      | ![blast](/static/img/thunder_road/blast.png) | Roll the direction and stunt dice.  Move that many spaces in the indicated direction. Ignore all spaces in between, but you are still affected by the space you move into. |
  - name: The Board Spaces
    text: |
      ### Terrain

      | Space | Effect |
      | ----- | ------ |
      | ![road](/static/img/thunder_road/road.png) | Costs 1 move to enter. May allow the [road die](#road_die) to be used. |
      | ![off_road](/static/img/thunder_road/off_road.png) | Costs 1 move to enter. |
      | ![mud](/static/img/thunder_road/mud.png) | Costs 2 moves to enter. You may still enter a mud space if you only have 1 movement left. |
      | ![impassable](/static/img/thunder_road/impassable.png) | This is an *obstacle* (see below). Impassable spaces are always marked with a double yellow border. |
      | ![hazard](/static/img/thunder_road/hazard.png) | These spaces show you where to place hazard tiles when a [new road tile is added](#move_off). If there is no tile on the space when entering it, treat it as if there was no symbol. |

      ### Obstacles
      * Obstacles are road vehicles, choppers, hazard tokens (face up or face
        down), and impassable spaces. Spaces without obstacles are "empty"
        spaces.
      * If a road vehicle enters a space with an obstacle, resolve this as
        follows:
          * **Occupied space**: If your car enters a space with another
            road vehicle, it loses its remaining moves. Stack it on top of the
            other vehicle and resolve a [slam](#slam).
          * **Chopper**: You may pass through a space with a chopper, but if
            a road vehicle ends its movement in a chopper space (during normal
            movement or as a result of [slam](#slam)/damage), the road
            vehicle is eliminated.
          * **Face-down hazard**: If a road vehicle enters a space with a
            face-down hazard, flip it over and resolve it.
          * **Face-up hazard**: Immediately resolve the hazard when a road
            vehicle enters this space.
          * **Impassable space**: (see above) A road vehicle that enters this
            space is eliminated.

      ### Hazards
      | Tile | Effect |
      | ---- | ------ |
      | ![wreck](/static/img/thunder_road/wreck.png) | Place a [wreck](#wrecks) in the space and place the moving road vehicle on top of it and resolve a [slam](#slam). Discard the hazard token. |
      | ![mine](/static/img/thunder_road/mine.png) | The road vehicle takes a damage (and resolves it) and any remaining movement is lost.  Discard the hazard token. |
      | ![road](/static/img/thunder_road/road_haz.png) | This becomes a road space, leave it on the board. |
      | ![mud](/static/img/thunder_road/mud_haz.png) | This becomes a mud space, leave it on the board. |
      | ![oil](/static/img/thunder_road/oil.png) | Roll the direction die and move your road vehicle 1 space in that direction (this does not cost a movement point). The vehicle continues moving (if it has remaining movement). Leave this token on the board. |

        id: move_off
        text: |
          When a car moves off the front of the lead road tile, 1 of 2 things
          happen:

          * If the car moved onto the [finish line](#end_game), the game ends
            and that player wins.
          * Otherwise, do the following:
              1. All cars on the rear tile are eliminated.
              2. All hazard tokens on the rear tile are eliminated.
              3. All choppers on the rear tile are returned to their owners.
              4. Remove the rear tile, flip it over, and place it on the
                 bottom of the road tile stack.
              5. Slide the middle and lead tiles backward.
              6. Place a new lead road tile from the stack as the lead tile.
              7. Place random hazard tokens face down on the new lead tile.
                  * If you ever run out of hazard tokens, shuffle the discard
                    to make a new draw pile.
              8. If playing with [2 players](#end_game) and this was the 5th
                 tile, add the finish line to the end of it.
              9. If the car that moved off the board has moves remaining, it
                 continues its movement.
      - name: Slamming
        id: slam
        text: |
          * When 2 vehicles are stacked in the same space, a slam is resolved.
              * This can happen due to movement, hazards, or damage effects.
              * This ends the movement of the moving vehicle.
          * Resolve a slam:
              1. Roll the slam and direction dice.
              2. If 1 of the 2 vehicles are larger than the other, the owner
                 of the larger vehicle may request 1 reroll.
                  * This is true even if the larger vehicle is inoperable.
                  * This is also true when 1 player owns both vehicles.
              3. Move the affected vehicle (top or bottom from the slam die)
                 1 space in the direction indicated on the direction die.
          * It's possible for the car that was moved 1 space to cause another
            slam, which should then be resolved (continue until there is only
            1 car in each space).
      - name: Road Die
        id: road_die
        text: |
          * This is rolled by the 1st player at the start of each round.
          * This gives a bonus to cars that start on, and only move on, road
            spaces for their movement.
          * The bonus allows the player to move their vehicle an extra
            number of spaces as indicated on the road die.
              * The bonus movement does *not* have to on the road.
              * The bonus movement is optional, but if used, you must move
                the full amount.
      - name: Coasting
        id: coast
        text: |
          * If a die is used for coasting, move that car exactly 1 space
            (disregard the value of the die).
          * You may **not** use the road die when coasting.
          * You may shoot if there is a target.
      - name: Car Damage
        id: damage
        text: |
          * When your car takes damage, choose a random [damage
            token](#damage_tokens) from the pile, flip it over, and
            resolve any effect on it.
          * After resolving any effects on the tile, place it face down
            in a damage slot for the car.
          * If a car has 2 damage tokens, it is *inoperable*.
              * Turn the car to face backwards on the board (showing that it's
                inoperable).
              * Flip the car's dashboard over to the inoperable side.
              * The car can be repaired with a [repair command](#command) and
                become operable once more.
              * It cannot take more damage. If damage would be assigned, it is
                ignored.
              * It cannot be assigned movement dice or shoot.
              * It can still be affected by the FX dice, like being
                [slammed](#slam).
          * If a car is *eliminated*, it is removed from the game and cannot
            be repaired.  It's damage tokens should be shuffled back into the
            damage token pile and its dashboard should be removed from the
            game.  A car can be eliminated when it:
              * Enters an impassable space.
              * Ends a turn in the same space as any chopper (even your own).
              * Is on a rear road tile when that tile is removed.
              * Leaves the board from the left, right, or rear edge, usually
                from damage or being [slammed](#slam).
              * Encounters an effect that directly eliminates it.
          * If **all** of a player's cars are either inoperable or eliminated,
            that player is [out of the game](#end_game).
      - name: Wrecks
        id: wrecks
        text: |
          * Wrecks are treated as inoperable small cars.
          * Wrecks are slammed if another car enters its space.
          * Resolve a hazard if they enter a space with a hazard.
          * Wrecks are eliminated if they end a turn in the same space as a
            chopper or take any damage.
