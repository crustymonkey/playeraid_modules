          1.  Set the main board in the center of the table
          2.  Give each player 1 player board, 1 light point tracker,
              6 seeds, and 14 trees: 8 small, 4 medium, and 2 tall
          3.  Separate the scoring tokens by their backs (shade of green and
              number of of leaves and set them next to the board in stacks
              ordered by points.  **If you are playing a 2 player game**, do
              put the 3 darkest (4 leaf) scoring tokens back in the box.  If
              players score the middle space on the board, they take from the
              3 leaf stack instead.
          4.  Place 4 seeds, 4 small trees, 3 medium trees, and 2 large trees
              on the corresponding spaces on each player board.  Set the light
              point tracker to 0.
          5.  Place the remaining 2 seeds, 4 small trees, and 1 medium tree
              next to the player boards.  These are the players' **available**
              trees at the beginning of the game.
          6.  The youngest player takes the First Player Token.
          7.  In turn order each player places 1 of their **available** small
              trees on a space of the **external edge** of the main board
              (the 1 leaf zone).  **Do this twice**.
          8.  Place the sun segment on the sun symbol printed on the board. 
              Set the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd revolution counters in a stack 
              near the edge of the board in numerical order with 3 on the top.
              *If you are playing the advanced version*, use all 4 counters,
              with the 4 on the top.
    - name: Playing a Round
      text: |
          Each time the sun is in one position, a round is played.  Each round
          consists of 2 phases.
      sections:
          - name: 1. The Photosynthesis Phase
            text: |
                *  The player with the 1st Player Token moves the sun segment
                   clockwise to the next angle on the board hex (**Note: this
                   step is skipped in the 1st round**).
                *  Players collect light points for each tree that is **not
                   in the shadow of another tree**.
                    *  A small tree scores 1 point
                    *  A medium tree scores 2 points
                    *  A large tree scores 3 points
                    *  No points are scored for seedlings
                *  A player **cannot have more than 20 light points!**

                ## Shadow sizes
                Trees cast shadows in the direction shown on the sun segment.
                A tree that is **taller** than a shadow-casting tree is **not
                shadowed** and receives **full** light points.  Trees in the
                shadow cast their own shadow, and trees still cast shadows on
                their own variety.  Shadows are cast as follows:
                
                *  Small trees cast a 1 space shadow
                *  Medium trees cast a 2 space shadow
                *  Large trees cast a 3 space shadow

                In turn order, each player can now spend their light points to
                take any number of actions (below).  Any light points leftover
                can be saved for the next round.  Each player performs all their
                actions before the next player takes their turn.  
            
                **IMPORTANT**: During their turn, a player can only perform
                **1 action on the same space on the main board**.  For example,
                a player cannot grow a tree more than one "step" on a single
                turn.

                *Note that any seeds/trees that are added/upgraded on the main
                board must come from the players' **available** pool, **not**
                from their player board*
            sections:
                - name: Buy Action
                  text: |
                      Players can purchase seeds or trees from their board
                      and add them to their available pool.  They **must buy
                      from the bottom of the board up** (least expensive to
                      most expensive).
                - name: Planting a Seed Action
                  text: |
                      Players can plant a seed near one or more of their trees,
                      paying **1 light point per seed**.  Seeds can be
                      planted in any direction, *including non-linear
                      directions*, as long as the spaces connect.

                      * 1 space from a small tree
                      * Up to 2 spaces from a medium tree
                      * Up to 3 spaces from a large tree

                      **Planting a seed activates both the origin tree's space
                      and the space the seed was planted on**.  Therefore,
                      during that turn, no other actions can be taken using
                      those spaces.
                - name: Growing a Tree Action
                  text: |
                      A seed or tree can be replaced by a tree that is the
                      next size up.

                      * Seed -> small tree: costs 1 light point
                      * Small tree -> medium tree: 2 light points
                      * Medium tree -> large tree: 3 light points

                      *Players can only take trees from their **available**
                      area to grow seeds/trees, **not** from their player
                      boards*

                      Trees/seeds that are removed from the main board are put
                      back on the player board in the topmost available spot.
                      **If no spots are available on the player board, the
                      trees/seeds are removed from the game**.
                - name: Collecting Action
                  text: |
                      Players can choose to collect scoring tokens by ending
                      the life cycle of their **large** trees.  Doing so
                      **costs 4 light points per large tree**.

                      *  The large tree is removed from the main board and
                         placed on the player board in the topmost available
                         spot
                      *  The player collects the scoring token from the top
                         of the matching pile of tokens (color/number of
                         leaves).  If there are no tokens left in that pile,
                         the player takes the top token of the next lower pile.
                      *  If a tree is removed, **other** players **can** plant
                         in that space during that round.
    - name: Ending a Round
      text: |
          After everyone has had a turn, the 1st player token is passed
          clockwise to the next player.  If the sun has completed one
          revolution, remove the top token from the sun revolution counter
          pile and put it in the box.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
          The game ends when the sun has completed 3 revolutions (4 in the
          advanced variant).  The full game is 18 rounds (24 in the advanced
          variant) with sun ending in the 6th position (the 1 before the sun
          symbol on the board).

          *  Score scoring tokens
          *  Score 1 point for every 3 unused light points

          *If there is a tie*, the player with the most seeds and trees on the
          main board wins.
