        The game takes place over 3 epochs, each separated into 2 phases,
        with the player with the most points after the 3 epochs winning the
        game.

        ## General notes

        * The player with the lowest initiative value on their setup card will
          go 1st in the 1st epoch.
        * The 2nd lowest value will go 1st in the 2nd epoch.
        * The 3rd lowest value will go 1st in the 3rd epoch.
        * If you reach the end of a track, use a "+10" marker at the end of
          the track to show that you have a value of more than 10 on that
          track.
        * Costs for cards vary by epoch:
            * **Epoch I**: 1-4 coins
            * **Epoch II**: 4-7 coins
            * **Epoch III**: 7-9 coins

        - name: Phase A
          id: phase_a
          text: |
            There are a number of steps in this phase that are completed
            in order. There are some steps that are done in player order and
            some that are done simultaneously

            1. The 1st player for the epoch sets the wheel in the center of
               the board such that each player icon points to a deck.
            2. (simultaneous) Each player draws 2 cards from the deck next to
               their player icon.
            3. (simultaneous) With the 2 cards, each player chooses 1 to buy
               or sell, while discarding the other card.
                * **You must discard 1 of the 2 cards**.
                    * Place the discarded card face up in the discard pile of
                      the corresponding color.
                * **Buy**: Pay the cost of the card ([red]!red! number) with
                  a discount of 1 coin per card of that color you *already*
                  have.
                    * Place the card below your player board under the
                      corresponding color -- overlap the cards so you
                      can see the values at the top.
                    * Move up on the designated track(s) by the amount(s)
                      shown.
                    * [purple]!purple! cards may have effects on them. Those
                      become immediately available after purchase.
                * **Sell**: Remove the card from the game (**not** discarded)
                  and gain the coins shown in the [green]!green! number.
            4. Rotate the wheel 1 position clockwise and then go to #2.
               Repeat this process until all of the facedown piles on the board
               are empty.
            5. Once all the facedown piles are empty, proceed to the
               [End of Phase A/B](#ab_end)
        - name: End of Phase A/B
          id: ab_end
          text: |
            Once all the cards have been drafted, the following steps are
            done, in order.

            1. Each player takes coins equal to the value of their income
               track.
            2. (in player order) Each player may take 1 colony if they meet
               the military requirement for it.
                * The value of the player's military must be >= the requirement
                  in the lower left hand part of the colony.
                * Note that you will never lose a colony you have acquired,
                  even if your military track decreases below the requirement
                  for the colony.
                * **You may only take 1 colony from each of the 5 requirement
                  levels** (3, 9, 15, 21, 30).
                    * You may take colonies in any order.
                * You may only take 1 colony during this step.
                * Do **not** look at the back of the colony, unless you choose
                  to *integrate* it.
                * You may either *plunder* the colony or *integrate* it.
                    * In either case, the colony is placed to the left of your
                      player board.
                    * **Plunder**: Gain the coins specified by the
                      [green]!green! number.
                    * **Integrate**: Pay the cost indicated by the [red]!red!
                      number and flip the colony over and move up on the
                      indicated tracks. Again, you **cannot look at the
                      back of the colony before choosing to integrate it**.
            3. (in player order) Each player may carve a statue if they
               meet the culture requirement for it.
                * The value of the player's culture must be >= the requirement
                  on the statue space they wish to build.
                * Note that you will never lose a statue you have acquired,
                  even if your culture track decreases below the requirement
                  for the statue.
                * You may only take carve 1 statue during this step.
                * Each statue may only be carved once.
                * Statues may be carved in any order.
                * You cannot flip a bonus tile after it has been placed.
                * Place 1 of your unused bonus tiles on your player board in
                  it's space. The tile may be place face up or face down.
                    * **Face up**: (colored side) Advance 1 space on the
                      matching colored track.
                    * **Face down**: At the end of the game, gain the points
                      next to the bonus tile space in addition to the points
                      for building the statue.
        - name: Phase B
          text: |
            1. Starting with the 1st player, each player takes 1 face up card
               from the **top** of a discard pile (wheel position does not
               matter).
                * You cannot look through any of the cards in any piles.
                * You can buy or sell the card as described in
                  [Phase A](#phase_a).
            2. Repeat step #1 until there are no cards left on the board.
            3. Resolve the 3 steps in [End of Phase A/B](#ab_end) again.
            4. You now must feed your people.
                * You must count the number of cards you have acquired (not
                  including your setup card) and:
                    * **If your food track is >= the number of cards**,
                      nothing happens.
                    * **If your food track is < the number of cards**, you
                      must choose and remove cards (from the game) until
                      the total number of cards equals your food track.
                        * When you remove a card, you must **decrease** all the
                          tracks by the values shown.
                        * If a card has an effect, you lose that effect.
                        * Do **not** gain coins for cards, as you would when
                          selling them.
                        * If you remove a card with a food value, you must
                          now meet the new value of the food track. (bad idea)
            5. Players may now buy gold/silver medals. (see below for costs)
                * **Silver medals**: Score points (end of game) equal to
                  half the value (rounded up) of the track matching the
                  bonus tile used.
                    * Place 1 of your unused bonus tiles onto an empty
                      silver medal space on your player board.
                * **Gold medals**: Score 7 points (end of game) per set of 5
                  differently colored cards you have.
                    * Place 1 of your gold medals onto 1 of the empty gold
                      medal spaces on your player board.
                * You can buy a max of 2 silver medals and 2 gold medals during
                  the game.
                * You may buy any number of silver/gold medals during this
                  step (up to the max).
