      Players will continue taking turns, with the last player on the time
      track always taking the next turn.  This continues until someone finds
      the lost species.

      Each turn consists of the following steps:

      1. Take 1 action (from the 5 available actions).
      2. Advance your pawn on the time track based on the cost of the action.
          * Skip over any expedition leader spaces (wood-grain); do **not**
            count these as spaces for your movement.
          * If you end with another player, place your pawn **ahead** of the
            other player(s).
      3. Activate and advance the expedition leader, if necessary.  This will
         happen when the leader is furthest back on the time track.
          1. 1st activate the leader's space, performing the [phase](#phases)
             shown on the current space.
          2. 2nd move the pawn to the next expedition leader space (wood-grain
             space).

      - name: Visit a Town (1 time)

  - name: End of Game
    text: |
      The game end is triggered when a player correctly locates the lost
      species.

      * That player must still pay the time penalty (5 time) for
        the attempt.
      * Each other player gets 1 final opportunity to score
        points if their pawn is at least 1 space back from the player who
        located the lost species.
      * Based on how far back the player is from the player who found the
        lost species, they can do 1 of the following:
          * Report sightings (see the [Sighting Phase](#phases).
              * 1-3 spaces behind the leader:  Report 1 sighting.
              * 4-5 spaces behind the leader:  Report 2 sightings.
          * Locate the lost species using the normal action.
              * **Do not move your pawn to spend time**.  Instead, if
                correct, gain 4-12 points based on how far back you are
                on the time track (see below).

      ## Final Scoring
      1. Press the "End Game & Reveal All" button in the app to reveal the
         locations of all animals on the board.
      2. Flip all remaining face-down animal tokens on the board and remove
         any incorrect sightings.
          * Any correct sightings that were the 1st to be placed do receive
            the leader bonus.
      3. Score 1 point for each area where you were the first player (or tied)
         to report the correct sighting for the area.  These are the circled
         numbers in the lower right of your note sheet.
      4. Score points for each correct sighting:
          * Lories: 2 points each
          * Cuscus: 3 points each
          * Toads: 4 points each
          * Python: 5 points
      5. Score any end game town cards.
      6. Score 12 points if you were the 1st player to locate the lost species.
      7. If you located teh lost species, but were not the 1st player to do
         so, score points based on how far behind you are from the 1st player
         to located the lost species:
          * 5 spaces back: 12 points
          * 4 spaces back: 10 points
          * 3 spaces back: 8 points
          * 2 spaces back: 6 points
          * 1 spaces back: 4 points

      Whoever has the most points wins. If there is a tie:

      1. The tied player who ended with the most points for discovering the
         lost species wins.
      2. The tied player who scored the most points for leader bonuses wins.
      3. The tied players share the victory.

      ### Town Phase
      ![town](/static/img/the_search_for_lost_species/town.png)

      * Return all town tokens on the map to the players.

      ### Camera Phase
      ![camera](/static/img/the_search_for_lost_species/camera.png)

      * Return all camera trap tokens on the map to the players.

      ### Conference Phase
      ![conf](/static/img/the_search_for_lost_species/conf.png)

      * All players receive the same new piece of information about the
        location of the lost species.
      * Select the matching conference (1 or 2) in the app and announce the
        new rule to all players.
      * The conferences are only performed the 1st time the leader activates
        this space.

      ### Sighting Phase
      ![sighting](/static/img/the_search_for_lost_species/sighting.png)

      This phase is done in 2 steps.

      1. Report sightings.
          1. All players simultaneously select the sighting tokens (0, 1, or
             2 tokens) in secret, placing them face down under their hand (so
             no one knows the number of tokens you've selected).  Once everyone
             is ready, proceed to the next step.
          2. All players then reveal the **face-down** tokens they've selected
             and, in player order (back to front), place them on the map
             where they believe the matching animal type is.
              * If you place on a space where someone else has placed **this
                round**, place your token on top of the stack.
              * Tokens can be placed on any island area (you don't have to
                be on/adjacent to it).
              * You **cannot** place 2 of the same token in the same area.
              * You **can** place 2 different tokens in the same area, but not
                during the same sighting phase.
              * You can always pick up and view your previously placed tokens.
          3. Place a timing token on top of each new stack of tokens placed
             on the board.  The number should match the top number in the
             sighting illustration.
      2. For each area with a timing token matching the bottom number in the
         sighting illustration do the following:
          1. Reveal all sightings under the matching timing token in an area.
              * Do **not** reveal other tokens under other timing tokens.
          2. Use the "Confirm Sightings" in the app and select 1 of the
             animals and the matching area.
          3. Announce whether the result was correct or not.
              * If correct, the player(s) with the correct animal should circle
                the area's number on the bottom right of their note sheet
                **if they are the 1st to find the animal in this area**.
                  * All players should circle this as the correct animal
                    on their note sheet.
                  * Flip all other sighting tokens in the area face up and
                    remove any incorrect tokens **from the game**.  Players
                    advance their pawn 1 space for each incorrect token.
                  * No other tokens can be placed on this area.
                  * Leave all correct tokens on the space for end game
                    scoring.
              * If incorrect, test the next animal token (if different) for
                this sighting token.
                  * Incorrect tokens are removed **from the game** and the
                    players advance their pawn 1 space.
                  * Do not reveal any other token under other timing tokens.
