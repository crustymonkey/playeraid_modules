             and a backpack.

             in the order shown below, starting at their backpack, which should
             be the furthest left item. This is known as the Player Path.

          8. Set aside the remaining leaf tiles for now.

          Players take turns in clockwise order. A turn consists of **1 main
          action** plus any number of special actions that can be taken
          **before or after** the main action.

          The game end is triggered when 1 player has covered their **entire**
          forest floor.  The round is played until all players have had
          equal turns, and then proceed to [end of game](#end_game).

          ## Main Action
          You may perform 1 of the 2 main actions following [tile placement
          rules](#tile_placement).  **You are not allowed to pass**.

          1. Take 1 leaf tile from your player path and place it on your
             forest floor.
          2. Take 1 squirrel from the supply and place it on your forest floor.
             Squirrels are **never placed into your supply**.

          ## The Common Path
          When the common path contains **less than 7 tiles**, refill it with
          the tiles that were set aside during setup.  These are added to
          the end of the current path. During the game, repeat this as
          necessary until all tiles have been added to the common path.

                * [place them with the hole over printed treasures]!green!.
                * [place them on a line between 2 or more areas]!green!.
                * [place leaf tiles or squirrels so they are **not** adjacent
                  with other tiles (you can place them anywhere)]!green!
                * [only place them in your main action]!green!.
                * [not place them on animal tiles]!red!.
                * [not place them on squirrels]!red!.
                * [not place them overlapping or onto tiles]!red!.
                * [not place them where the stick out over an edge of your
                  forest floor]!red!.
                * [never move them again when your main action is complete]!red!

                With animal tiles, you may:

                * [only put them on free holes in the leaf tiles whose outline
                  corresponds to the shape of the animal]!green!

                All other restraints apply for animal tiles as leaf tiles.

                * If you cover a printed treasure with the **hole** on your
                  leaf tile, take the same treasure from the supply and cover
                  that hole.
                * Nothing happens if you completely cover up a treasure with
                  a leaf tile or squirrel.
                * When you have completed a 3x4 area of your board by covering
                  all of the spaces in it (including holes), you immediately
                  take all of the treasures in that area on your leaf tiles
                  and add them to your supply.

                Refill your player path immediately when you take the last
                leaf tile from your player path.  To do this:

                1. take the first 5 leaf tiles next to the berry bush and
                   place them next to your backpack, **preserving the order**
                   (first leaf tile is next to your backpack).
                2. Then, move the berry bush to fill the gap.

                You may also pay 1 berry to take new leaf tiles, even when you
                still have leaf tiles.  See [treasures](#treasures) for more
                information.

                * At any time during your turn, you may take a place an animal
                  tile over **free** holes on your board.
                    * The shape of the animal tile **must** correspond to the
                      shape of the holes.
                * Any printed treasures covered up are taken from the supply
                  and added to your personal supply.
                * **Note**: The holes **must be empty** when placing the
                  animal tile.  They **cannot** have treasures over them.
                * If you've taken an animal tile with a treasure on it, also
                  take that treasure.

          You can play use as many treasures as you would like before or
          after your main action.  **Instead of a normal main action, you
          may execute 1 alternative main action**. These will involve a
          mushroom or feather.

          You may have as many treasures as you like in your personal supply.

          * ![berry](/static/img/indian_summer/berry.png) **Berry**:
            Spending a berry allows you to refill your player path to 5 tiles.
            If you already have 5 tiles, you may take a 6th tile.  You can
            **never have more than 6 tiles** in your player path.
          * ![nut](/static/img/indian_summer/nut.png) **Nut**: Spend a nut to
            place a squirrel tile from the supply onto your forest floor.
            The same rules apply if you fill an area as described under
            [treasure management](#treasure_mgmt).
          * ![mushroom](/static/img/indian_summer/mushroom.png) **Mushroom**:
            Take the first leaf tile from **2 other players** (next to their
            backpack) and place them on your forest floor.  If there is no
            more space on your forest floor, you can then place only 1 of the
            tiles, otherwise you **must** place both.
              * **2 player game**: You take an opponents leaf tile and the
                1st tile in the common path.
              * If you take the last leaf tile from an opponent, they refill
                their path immediately as described in the [player path
                section](#player_path). If this happened to both players, they
                refill in turn order.
              * This is done **instead of your main action**.
          * ![feather](/static/img/indian_summer/feather.png) **Feather**:
            Place **2** leaf tiles from your player path onto your forest
            floor.
              * **You must have 2 leaf tiles on your player path to perform
                this action!**
              * This is done **instead of your main action**.

          ### Exchanging Treasures
          As depicted on the game board, you may exchange treasures in the
          following manner:

          * Exchange 1 treasure for a treasure of lower value.
          * Exchange 2 berries for 1 nut.
          * Exchange 2 nuts for 1 mushroom.
          * Exchange 2 mushrooms for 1 feather.

          The game ends when 1 person has completely filled their forest floor
          and the round completes such that everyone has had the same number
          of turns.

          * The player who has completed their forest floor wins.
          * If there is a tie, the tied players should convert all their
            remaining treasures to nuts and the **player with the most nuts
            wins**.
          * If there is still a tie, the player with a remaining berry wins.
          * If there is still a tie, the players share the victory.

          For the ordering of players that did not complete their forest floor,
          the player with the least number of empty spaces ranks higher.
