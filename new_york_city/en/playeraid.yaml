      The game is played over 5 rounds, with each round consisting of 4
      phases.

      ### General Rules
      * Player order and tie breaks are done via the press track.
          * If there are multiple tokens on the same space, the one on top is
            furthest ahead.
          * If you reach the last space on the track, place your token at the
            bottom of the stack on that space.
      * Character cards have either a phase they activate in (I/II/III) or an
        end game symbol (→|).
          * To use a character, you must pay 1 dollar, except for characters
            that score you end game points.

        text: |

          * Move the mayor to the next borough in alphabetical order (A -> E).
              * If this is the 1st round, place him in the "A" borough.
              * Flip the tile over in the current borough and move him to the
                next one.
              * The mayor **never** enters the "X" borough.
          * Reveal the top 2 prestige tiles and place them on their spots near
            the stack.
          * Each player draws 3 cards from the deck.
          * Deal out a number of pairs of cards face up based on the player
            count (2 x number of players + 1):
              * 4 players: 9 pairs
              * 3 players: 7 pairs
              * 2 players: 5 pairs
      - name: "Phase I: Select Cards"
        text: |
          * In **reverse** player order (press tokens), each player takes 1
            pair of cards. Do this a 2nd time so that each player has taken 2
            pairs.
      - name: "Phase II: 6 Bidding Rounds"
        text: |
          * The 6 rounds pertains to the 6 different types of cards (not
            counting wilds).
              * The order and types are shown on your player board.
          * During this phase, players may exchange 1 of their cards in hand
            for 1 of the cards in their reserve.
              * Your reserve will **always** have 2 cards in it.
              * You cannot play cards from your reserve.
          * The bidding always proceeds in clockwise order, **not in player
            order**.
          * Each auction is once around.
          * The player furthest ahead starts the 1st bidding round.
          * In rounds 2-5, the player who won the last bid starts the round.
          * When bidding:
              * Play any number of cards matching the round + wild cards.
              * Wild cards **cannot** be played on their own.
              * 2 identical cards may be played as any other card. Note that
                it only counts as **1** card for the purpose of the total.
              * Your total bid is the number of cards + any abilities on
                characters.
          * The highest bid gets the bonus (usually a "+1").
              * Break ties via the press track.
          * All players perform the related action in press track order
            (when relevant).  e.g. Players can always take their
            dollars simultaneously (round 2), but moving on the press track
            (round 1) is done in order.

          ## Actions by Round
          1. In press track order, each player advances a number of spaces
             equal to their bid.
              * If you land on another token, place yours on top, unless it
                is the last space, then it is placed on the bottom.
              * **Highest bid bonus**: Advance 1 extra space.
          2. Take a number of dollars equal to your bid.
              * **Highest bid bonus**: Gain 1 extra dollar.
          3. Take **1** character from the display with a value <= to their
             bid value.
              * **Highest bid bonus**: +1 bidding value for choosing a
                character.
          4. Players take a number of their skyscrapers from the supply equal
             to their bid value.
              * **Highest bid bonus**: Gain 1 additional skyscraper.
          5. Gain a number of points equal to your bid value
              * **Highest bid bonus**: Select 1 of the 2 prestige tiles from
                the board and place it on 1 of boroughs connected by a matching
                **vessel**.  Then take that vessel and place 1 skyscraper in
                that same borough.
              * **2nd Highest bid bonus**: Select the remaining prestige tile
                from the board and repeat the process as the highest bidder
                did.
              * Players can forfeit their bid bonus (usually because they
                don't want to increase a borough's value).
              * Any leftover prestige tiles are removed from the game.
          6. Place a number of skyscrapers **from your player board** and
             place them in the borough with the mayor.
              * If a player has skyscrapers on their board, they **must**
                build them.
              * If a player has no skyscrapers on their board, they may move
                1 skyscraper from another borough to the mayor's borough.
              * **Highest bid bonus**: Build 1 additional skyscraper.
          7. The 1st player to have built a skyscraper in all boroughs flips
             the Statue of Liberty tile and gains 4 points.
              * If more than 1 player has done this at the end of the same
                bidding round, all players get the 4 points.
      - name: "Phase III: Activating Phase III Characters"
        text: |
          1. In player order, players may spend 1 dollar (each) to activate
             each of their phase III characters.
          2. All leftover cards in a players' hands are discarded.
  - name: Game End
    text: |
      The game ends after the 5th round. Score as follows.

      * Each character scores a number of points equal to the value in the top
        right of the card.
      * Calculate characters end game points (with a →| symbol).
      * Score the 6 boroughs. Players earn points based on their rank (number
        of skyscrapers) in each borough, with ties broken by the press track.
          * **Important**: When determining rank, **include** the neutral
            skyscrapers. e.g. If someone has only 1 skyscraper in a borough,
            they rank *below* the neutrals.
          * If you have no skyscrapers in a borough, you do not score any
            points there.
          * The total points for a borough is always the base tile plus
            any prestige tiles in the borough.
          * 1st: Score the total number points.
          * 2nd: Half the number of points for 1st, rounded up.
          * 3rd: Half the number of points for 2nd, rounded up.
          * 4th: Half the number of points for 3rd, rounded up.
          * 5th: Half the number of points for 4th, rounded up.
      * Each player who built skyscrapers in all 6 boroughs earns 3 points.
      * Each player who reached at least space 5 on the press track scores
        3 points.
      * Add dollars + skyscrapers on player boards (not the supply) and divide
        by 2, rounded up, and score that many points.

      The player with the most points wins. Break ties in press track order.
