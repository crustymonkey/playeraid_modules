              The House player will simply facilitate the race unless you have
              chosen to use one of the [House variants](#house_variants). There
              is also an app available to run the race for you. See
              [Setup](#setup) for links for various platforms.

              * Roll the 2 dice, announce the result, and move the horse
                associated with the die roll 1 space forward on the horse track.
              * **If the same number is rolled twice in a row**, move the horse
                a number of **additional** spaces as indicated in the row on
                the board. (note that 7 has no bonus)
                  * The bonus **is** triggered for 2/3 no matter which number
                    is rolled, and similarly for 11/12.  e.g. if a 2 is rolled
                    followed by a 3, the bonus is triggered for the 2/3 horse.
                  * The bonus is **NOT** triggered on a 3rd consecutive roll,
                    but it *would* be triggered again on a 4th consecutive
                    roll.
              * When the 3rd horse crosses the [red bet line]!red!, the House
                player announces "No more bets". The House player continues
                to roll dice as usual until **1** horse gets to the finish
                at which time the race immediately ends.
              * The House marks the win/place/show tokens on the bet board.
                  * The tokens are placed on the bet board pointing at the
                    appropriate horse for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
                  * If 2 or more horses tie for 2nd, they essentially take
                    2nd and 3rd place so **no horses behind them will be
                    considered as "showing"**.

              ## Betting

              Players can place their bets at any time during the race until
              "No more bets" is called when 3 horses have crossed the [red bet
              line]!red! (see [Running a Race](#running)).

              * Players may not place a bet token on a space that already has
                a bet token.
              * Once a bet token is placed, it **cannot be moved/removed**.
              * Only 1 token can be place on the Prop bets (like other spaces).
              * Note that the Exotic Finish cards have 3 bet spots.
                  * A player **cannot** place more than 1 of their bet tokens
                    on the same card.
                  * For the "Photo Finish" card, remember that if horses are
                    tied for 2nd, they are *also* tied for 3rd.

              ## Resolving Bets

              After the race, bets are paid out.

              * Win/place/show:
                  * All bets for win/place/show are paid for the winning horse.
                  * All bets for place/show are paid for the 2nd place horse(s).
                  * All bets for show are paid for the 3rd place (if there is
                    one, see [Running a Race](#running)).
              * The amount paid to the player is the number on their bet token
                times the multiplier for the space.
              * For losing bets, if there is a [red circle]!red! with a number
                on the space, the player must **pay** that amount to the
                supply.
                  * If a player has no money to pay, they pay nothing.
                  * The value of the bet token means nothing for a losing bet.
              * **Bonus Bet Tokens** (black and white bet tokens):
                  * These are resolved just like other bet tokens for winning
                    bets.
                  * If the token has a [red circle]!red! with a number on the
                    space, the player must pay this amount **in addition to
                    anything printed on the board** for losing bets.
                  * If the token has a
                    ![no pay](/static/img/ready_set_bet/no_pay.png) symbol on
                    it, this means that the negative value printed on the
                    board space for a losing bet where this was placed is
                    **negated** (pay nothing).

              After each of the first 3 races:

              * Replace the 5 Prop bet cards.
              * Reveal an additional Exotic Finish card.
              * Deal 2 VIP cards to each player. Each player chooses 1 to keep
                and discards the other.
                  * VIP cards are placed face up in front the player and the
                    player gains the benefit for the rest of the game.
                  * If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard to create a new
                    deck.
                  * Some cards have a 1-time effect, but the card should
                    remain in front of the player and **not** be discarded.
              * Reset the horses on the horse board.
              * If using a [House variant](#house_variants), follow additional
                end of race instructions there.

          id: house_bets
          text: |
              * Before each race, the House player takes the 6 house bet tokens
                and places them in the upper left corner of 6 different bet
                spots of their choice.
                  * The House player starts the game with $18 and does not
                    draw any VIP cards.
                  * This includes Prop bet and Exotic finish betting spots.
                  * These bet spots are considered open for other players to
                    use.
                  * At the end of each race, the house bet tokens are resolved
                    in the same way as the player bet tokens.
        - name: House Rotation Variant (2-8 players)
          text: |
              * Randomly pick a House player for the 1st race.
              * The House player uses the 6 House bet tokens as described in
                the [House Bets variant](#house_bets).
              * After each race the House player may choose to remain the
                House player for the next race.
                  * If they choose not to be: Beginning with the player to
                    the House player's left, and continuing clockwise, each
                    player has the option to become the House player.
                  * If no one chooses to be the House player, the player to
                    the left of the House player **must** become the new
                    House player.
              * The House player may not use VIP cards for the round they
                are the House player.
                  * At the end of the round, the House player still draws and
                    selects a VIP card along with the other players.
                  * As compensation for not being able to use VIP cards, the
                    House player gains money from the supply (before the start
                    of the race in the noted rounds):
                      * $3 in round 2
                      * $6 in round 3
                      * $9 in round 4
