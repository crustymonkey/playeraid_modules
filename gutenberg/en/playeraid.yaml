                Players secretly plan their actions during this phase.

                * Each player hides their initiative board and markers behind
                  their screen.
                * Everyone simultaneously allocates their markers among the
                  5 actions.
                    * Markers go in empty slots, **from left to right** on
                      an action's row.
                * When all players are ready, the plans are revealed.
                * Actions are resolved from top to bottom.  Note that the
                  sequence on the initiative board matches the main board.
                * For each action, the number of player markers in that row
                  determines the player order for the action.
                    * The player with the most markers is 1st.
                    * Ties are broken by player order.
                * A player **must have at least 1 marker on an action to take
                  that action**.

                      * Each acting player may choose 1 printing and 1
                        refinement card from the main board, creating an order.
                      * The order is placed in a free slot connected to their
                        printing house board.
                          * The 2 cards of an order can **never** be separated
                            or re-combined.
                          * A player may have a max of 4 orders.
                          * If a player has 4 orders and takes another, they
                            must 1st discard an existing order.
                      * Once all players have taken this action, discard any
                        remaining printing and refinement cards.
                      * If a player receives an order as a reward, they draw
                        2 printing and 2 refinement cards from their decks and
                        chooses 1 of each type to keep.  The unchosen cards are
                        discarded.
                          * If a player doesn't like the drawn cards, they may
                            pay 2 guilders to draw 2 additional cards of their
                            choice (2 printing, 2 refinement, 1 of each).  This
                            **can be repeated** as many times as the player can
                            afford.

                      * Each acting player may select 1 of the 3 inks from the
                        main board and may take 1-3 inks from that set.
                          * The 1st ink is free, the 2nd costs 1 guilder, and
                            the 3rd costs 2 guilders.
                          * Inks **must be taken from left to right**.
                          * A player may choose a set that was partially taken
                            by another player, but **the costs remain the
                            same**, which means 1 or 2 guilders for the 2nd
                            and 3rd inks.
                          * Inks are placed next to the player's printing house
                            board.
                      * Once all players have taken this action, discard any
                        remaining inks back to the bag.

                  text: |
                      * Each player taking this action may choose 1 specialty
                        card from the main board.  Cards can be used in 1 of
                        2 ways:
                          * Move the indicated specialty marker(s) up 1 level
                            for each of that specialty's symbol on the card.
                          * Move any *other* specialty marker 1 level up.
                      * After players are done with this action, discard
                        all remaining specialty cards on the board.
                      * The 1st time a player reaches a level marked with
                        "**>**" on any of their specialty tracks, the player
                        advances their disc on the reward track to the next
                        space and takes the reward.
                      * Reaching the same reward level on another track does
                        **not** give any additional reward.
                      * If level VI is reached and the track would go up,
                        the player instead receives 3 guilders.

                      * Players taking this action may take 1 gear from the
                        main board.
                          * Gears are installed starting at the top gear
                            (number 1).
                          * Each successive gear must touch the previously
                            installed gear and should be correctly meshed.
                          * When adding a new gear, make sure that 1 of its
                            sectors lines up with the gear's active sector.
                      * Instead of taking a gear, a player can remove an
                        existing gear from their board, rotate it, and put it
                        back.
                      * A printing house can have at most 3 gears. If a player
                        has 3 gears and takes a new gear, they must discard
                        1 to make room for the new gear.
                      * If a player has used a gear this round, **that gear
                        cannot be repositioned or discarded**.
                      * The gear sections next to the lightened areas are
                        active.
                          * Players can gain the bonus from these sectors
                            at any time.
                          * When used, place a used gear marker on the gear.
                          * Rewards can only be gained once per round.
                          * Players are not required to take gear bonuses.
                          * See [Gear Rewards](#gear) for info on symbols.
                      * After players are done with this action, discard all
                        remaining gears.

                      Players taking this action may do 1 of these actions

                      * Choose 1  of the following available rewards by
                        putting their marker on it (not available to
                        anyone else this round).
                          * Take 1 order
                          * Advance 1 specialty by 1 level
                          * Take 3 guilders
                          * Take any 2 inks from the bag
                      * (**or**) Take 1 patronage card if the card's conditions
                        are met.
                          * The card may be taken if it's on a space below or
                            to the left of the round marker.
                          * If a player uses ink to take a patronage card,
                            the ink is put back in the bag.
                          * Types and specialties are not spent.
                          * **Note**: In the 1st 2 rounds, the round marker
                            has not reached any patronage cards.
          - name: Fulfill Orders
            text: |
                This is done in clockwise order, starting with the 1st player.

                ## Orders
                * To fulfill an order, the player needs the resources
                  indicated on the cards.
                * **Important**: Types and specialties are never
                  discarded. The player merely needs to have them to meet
                  requirements.
                * Printing cards reward *guilders* and refinement cards
                  reward *fame points*.
                * The printing card **must** be fulfilled to complete an
                  order.
                * The refinement card is **optional**. The player may
                  fulfill both, 1, or none of the requirements.
                * When the order is fulfilled, **both** cards are
                  discarded, regardless of how much of the refinement
                  card was fulfilled.
                * Unfulfilled orders simply remain in their slots.
                * Orders are fulfilled simultaneously. **You cannot
                  use rewards from 1 order to fulfill other orders**.

                ### Printing
                * The player assigns the required types to the printing card
                  and receives the specified number of guilders.
                * Again, **types are not spent**, but are retained.
                * Players can buy additional types. The cost is based on how
                  many types you already have (see table).

                | Cost | Buying n-th type |
                | ---- | ---------------- |
                | 3 | 3 |
                | 4 | 4 |
                | 5 | 5 |
                | ... | ... |

                * Players can buy types at any time during a round.  It is
                  **not an action**.
                * There is no limit on the number of types a player can own.
                * A given type can be **assigned to only 1 order in a round**.
                    * Types should be placed on order cards to show what is
                      being used where.
                * Types are unlimited, if a particular type runs out, use a
                  replacement.

                ### Refinements
                * Refinements include colors and decorations. Both parts are
                  optional.
                * Fulfilling both of the requirements gives an additional
                  bonus.
                * *Colors* require discarding (to the bag) matching inks.
                    * **Inks are limited by the bag's contents**.
                * *Decorations* require the player to have the indicated
                  specialties. Again, **specialties are never discarded**, you
                  must simply have them.

                | Reward | Description |
                | ------ | ----------- |
                | ![ink](/static/img/gutenberg/ink_reward.png) | Take the number of ink shown from the bag |

                Do the following at the end of each round:

                * **If any deck runs out, shuffle its discard to create a new
                  deck**.
                * Refill the main board:
                    * Order cards face-up on each printing and refinement card
                      space.
                    * 1 ink from the bag on each ink space.
                    * 1 face-up specialty card on each specialty space.
                    * 1 gear on each gear space.
                * Move the round marker 1 space.
                * Return all players' markers on patronage spaces.
                * Remove used gear markers from gears
                * Remove initiative markers from initiative boards.
                * Pass the 1st player token clockwise.
                * Each player gives 1 initiative marker to the player who just
                  passed the 1st player token.
                    * This means that the 1st player will have 7 initiative
                      markers, the 2nd player has 8, the 3rd player has 9 and
                      the 4th player has 10.
