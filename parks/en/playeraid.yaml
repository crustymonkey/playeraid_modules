            text: |
                Starting with the 1st player, each player takes a turn by
                moving 1 of their hikers to a site on the trail. Play
                continues clockwise.

                * Your hiker can be moved as far along the trail as the
                  player would like, **but you must be able to take the site
                  action**.
                    * If there is another hiker (including your own) is on the
                      site, you must flip your campfire tile to the extinguished
                      side.  **If it's already on the extinguished side, you
                      cannot move to a site with another hiker!**
                * Once you've moved to the site, you take any tokens on the
                  site, then perform the [action on the site](#actions).

                * **Canteens**: When you draw a canteen card, place it face
                  up with the
                  [empty canteen](/static/img/parks/canteen_empty.png) showing.
                    * To fill the canteen, place a **gained** water token on
                      the card and perform the action.
                    * **Canteens cannot be filled with water that was not
                      received during a turn**.
                    * You may have any number of canteens.
                    * Once filled, the water remains on it until the end of
                      the season and cannot be used until the water is
                      removed.
