        * Place the fauna board.
        * Give a player board to each player, making sure each player is using
          the front of their board.
        * Create a supply for sprouts, soil tokens, and trunk/canopy growth
          tokens.
        * Shuffle all the Earth cards and place them in a face down draw pile.
        * Shuffle all the fauna cards and place 1 on each of the 4 fauna
          spaces on the fauna board with either side face up. Return any
          remaining fauna cards to the box.
        * **For an advanced game**, deal out 2 island, 2 climate, and 2
          ecosystem cards to choose from (1 of each).  Otherwise:
            * Shuffle the ecosystem cards and place 1 on each of the 2
              ecosystem spaces on the fauna board with either side face up.
                * After that, deal 1 ecosystem card to each player.
                * Remaining ecosystem cards can be returned to the box.
            * Shuffle the Climate cards and deal 1 to each player. Return the
              remaining cards to the box.
            * Shuffle the island cards and deal 1 to each player.  All remaining
              cards can be returned to the box.
        * Randomly choose a start player and give them the 1st player token.
        * Each player now selects a side of their island, climate, and
          ecosystem cards.
        * Each player takes 5 leaf tokens of 1 color, placing 4 of them on
          the central leaf spaces on their player board.  Set the 5th aside to
          be used for tracking action selection each turn.
        * Each player draws a number of Earth cards shown on their island card.
            * Everyone simultaneously selects a number of cards to compost,
              as shown on their island card.
        * Each player takes a number of soil tokens equal to what is shown
          on their island card.

        The game is played over a number of rounds until, at the end of the
        round, a player has completed their island by placing their 16th
        card (4x4 grid).

        On your turn, you will choose any 1 of the 4 action spaces at the
        top of your player board, marking your choice with the leaf token
        that was set aside.

        * You may choose the same action as another player.
        * You may perform the same action multiple turns in a row.
        * If the Earth deck runs out, shuffle the discard to create a new
          draw pile.
            * Do **not** shuffle in compost cards.

        ### Activating Abilities

        * After an action is taken, **all players** may activate any
          abilities in their tableau that match the color of the action.
            * This should be done simultaneously.
            * Each ability can only be activated once per turn.
            * The tableau must be activated left to right, top to bottom.
            * You can activate your [Island]!#619B98! **and then** your
              [Climate]!#D48428! either before or after your tableau's
              activation.
                * **Both** must be activated either before or after tableau
                  activation.  You cannot activate 1 before and 1 after.
            * Some abilities with a negative number indicate a cost
              that must be paid to use them.
            * Any abilities with a numbered resource before a ":" must be
              paid to get the benefit on the right hand side.
            * Multicolored abilities that match the current action are also
              activated.
            * You are never forced to activate a card ability.
            * Black abilities are triggered only when played.
            * Brown abilities have end game scoring possibilities.

    - name: Cards
      sections:
        - name: Ecosystem Cards
          text: |
            These cards give end game scoring bonuses.

            * At the beginning of the game, you should choose the side of
              the card to use for the game.
            * There will be 3 ecosystem cards in play during a standard game.
              2 on the fauna board and 1 on your player board.
            * When given your card at the beginning of the game, you may
              choose either side of the card to use.
            * You may score ecosystem cards multiple times if they meet
              the requirements multiple times with different cards/components.
                * Once a card/component has been used to score an ecosystem
                  card, it cannot be used again for scoring on the **same**
                  ecosystem card.
        - name: Fauna Cards
          text: |
            These cards give in-game scoring objectives.

            * At the end of a turn in which a player fulfills an objective
              on 1 or more fauna cards, they claim the highest available VP
              tier next to the card by placing a leaf token on it.
            * If 2 or more players fulfill the objective on the same turn,
              leaf tokens are placed in clockwise turn order, starting with
              the active player.
            * Once claimed, a fauna objective cannot be lost, even if the
              state changes such that you no longer meet the objective.
            * The points for the fauna objectives are scored at the end of
              the game.
        - name: Island Cards
          text: |
            These cards give players their starting resources as well as an
            ability.

            * At the beginning of the game, you should choose the side of
              the card to use for the game.
            * Note that of the cards drawn, a number of them will be composted.
            * These cards can also count for ecosystem/fauna objectives.
        - name: Climate Cards
          text: |
            These cards give players another ability.

            * At the beginning of the game, you should choose the side of
              the card to use for the game.
            * These cards can also count for ecosystem/fauna objectives.
        - name: Earth Cards
          text: |
            The majority of the cards in the game are Earth cards:

            * 179 flora cards
            * 66 terrain cards
            * 38 event cards

            ### Flora

            Note that all cards are referred to as "cards", but flora cards
            are specifically referred to as "flora". This is important for
            ecosystem/fauna objectives.

            Flora is classified by type (equal amount of each):

            | Symbol | Type |
            | ------ | ---- |
            | ![tree](/static/img/earth/tree.png) | Tree |
            | ![herb](/static/img/earth/herb.png) | Herb |
            | ![mushroom](/static/img/earth/mushroom.png) | Mushroom |
            | ![bush](/static/img/earth/bush.png) | Bush |

            Habitats are used for scoring objectives. These are listed in the
            top right of cards.

            | Symbol | Type |
            | ------ | ---- |
            | ![sunny](/static/img/earth/sunny.png) | Sunny |
            | ![wet](/static/img/earth/wet.png) | Wet |
            | ![rocky](/static/img/earth/rocky.png) | Rocky |
            | ![cold](/static/img/earth/cold.png) | Cold |

            ### Terrain
            These cards often do not grant resources, but instead offer
            in- game effects or end-game scoring.

            ### Events
            These cards are different from the others in that they can be
            played at any time

            * These can be played on other players' turns or between the
              activation of 2 abilities.
            * They give you an instant benefit and don't directly affect other
              players.
            * These do **not** get added to your tableau.
                * When played they are placed face-up in the event space on
                  your player board.
            * These can either may earn **or lose** points at the end of the
              game.
            * Once played they cannot be exchanged, activated, or composted.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
        The game ends at the end of a round in which a player has completed
        their 4x4 tableau (16 cards).

        * The player who 1st completes their tableau places a leaf token on
          the 7 VP bonus space on the fauna board.
            * If the active player and another player complete their tableaus
              on the same turn, the active player gets the bonus.
            * If multiple players, but not the active player, complete their
              tableau on the same turn, the player sitting closest to the
              active player, in clockwise order, claims the bonus.

        ### Scoring

        1. Add the base VP from your Island/Climate cards and all the cards
           in your tableau.
            * Do **not** include your event cards or cards in your compost
              pile.
        2. Add the base VP from cards in your event stack.
        3. Add 1 VP per card in your compost.
        4. Add 1 VP per sprout in your tableau.
        5. Add 1 VP per trunk in your tableau, unless the canopy has been
           placed, in which case you score the canopy VP **instead of 1
           VP/trunk**.
        6. Add VP from any terrain in your tableau with an end-game scoring
           bonus.
        7. Add VP from any fulfilled ecosystem objectives.
        8. Add VP from leaf tokens placed on the fauna board.
            * Add the 7 VP bonus if you were the 1st player to complete their
              tableau.

        If there is a tie, resolve the tie in the following order:

        1. Most soil
        2. Most cards in their hand
        3. Most growth in their tableau
        4. Most sprouts
        5. Most composted cards
