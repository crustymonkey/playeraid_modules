              monster islands such that **no color occurs twice on any
              island**.
        * Place the 3 statues of each color on the respective city tiles.
        * Shuffle the island tiles face down (cloud side up) and place them

            * 1 ship in your color
            * 1 shield
            * 12 Zeus tiles in your color
            * 1 player board

            * 3 shrines
            * 3 Oracle dice
            * 1 action overview
        * Determine a start player and give them 3 favor tokens. In clockwise
          order each player receives 1 more player token than the previous.
            * e.g. in a 3 player game, the start player gets 3 tokens, the 2nd
              player gets 4, and the 3rd player gets 5.
        * Distribute the ship tiles in 1 of 2 ways:
            1. Randomly take a ship tile.
            2. Randomly pick ship tiles such that you have an amount equal
               to the number of players + 1. Beginning with the last player
               and going counter-clockwise, each player selects a ship tile.
               Return the unused tile to the box.
        * The last player of the round takes the Titan die and places it
          in the center of their Oracle.

            * Place your ship on the starting space (where Zeus was placed
              earlier).
            * Sort your Zeus tiles.
                * 1 player should randomly choose 2 of the colored
                  offering/monster tiles and flip 2 of them to the monster
                  side (so that you have 2 offerings and 2 monsters).
                * All players should copy the player above so that each
                  player has identical starting Zeus tiles.
                * **First game variant**: Play with only 8 Zeus tiles by
                  returning 1 of each:

                      starting tiles left over**.
            * Place your action overview near your board.
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        Players take turns over a number of rounds until a player completes
        all of their Zeus tiles and returns to Zeus (starting point), at
        which the [game ends](#game_end) at the end of that round.

        Turns consist of up to 3 phases:

        1. **Check injuries**:
            * If you have more than 3 of the same color injury or a total of
              6 injuries, you forfeit your normal turn and instead discard
              3 injury cards of your choice.
            * If you have 0 injury cards, take 1 favor token **or** advance
              1 god 1 step.
        2. **Perform actions**: (see below for actions)
            * Use your 3 Oracle dice to take various actions.
            * Use **at most 1** Oracle card to perform an action with it.
            * Use special actions granted by gods on your god track.
        3. **Consult the Oracle**:
            * Roll your 3 Oracle dice and place them on the matching spaces.
                * All **other** players may advance a god matching one of the
                  colors rolled 1 step on their god track **if it is not on
                  the bottom row** (dark clouds).
            * If you are the last player of the round, roll the Titan die.
                * If a 6 is rolled, everyone draws 2 injury cards.
                * Otherwise, everyone evaluates their shield strength
                  compared to the roll.  If shield strength < the roll, take
                  1 injury.
      sections:
        - name: Color-independent Actions
          text: |
            There are some actions where the color of the die used to
            take the action doesn't matter.

            * **Draw 1 Oracle card**: Draw 1 Oracle card and place it face
              up next to your board.
                * **Reminder**: You may only use 1 Oracle card per round.
            * **Take 2 favor tokens**
            * **Look at 2 island tiles**: Look at 2 face down island tiles,
              then return them face-down to their respective locations.
        - name: Color-dependent Actions
          text: |
            ## General rules

            * You may recolor a die by spending 1 favor token per
              **clockwise** space you wish to move the die to.
            * To perform an action referring to an island space, your ship
              must be adjacent to that space.
            * The color of the die used **must** match the chosen action.

            ## Actions

            * **Move your ship**: Move your ship up to 3 water spaces,
              ending your movement on a space matching the die color.
                * You may not cross or land on island or shallows
                  (holes in the board) spaces.
                * You may spend to favor tokens to further your ship's
                  movement (1 space per token), but **you must still end
                  on a space matching the die color**.
                * Each water space can be occupied by any number of ships.
            * **Fight a monster**: Each fight consists of 1 or more rounds
              and ends when you either defeat the monster or surrender.
                * The color of the monster must match the die color used.
                * Each monster starts with a strength of 9.
                * A battle round consists of rolling the battle die and
                  doing 1 of the following:
                    * If the number rolled is >= 9 - your shield strength,
                      you defeat the monster and take the corresponding
                      reward on the Zeus tile. Place the defeated monster
                      in the lower right area of your player board.
                    * If you rolled less than the required number, you
                      have lost the round.
                        * If you rolled a zero, draw 1 injury card.
                        * You may pay 1 favor token to perform another
                          combat round.  Decrease the monster's strength
                          by 1 and roll again.
                        * If you cannot or do not want to fight another round,
                          the combat ends.
            * **Explore an island**: You must be adjacent to the island tile
              and your die must match the color of the hex.
                * If the image matches 1 of your Zeus tiles, place 1 of your
                  shrines on it and take the corresponding reward on the
                  Zeus tile. Return the Zeus tile to the box.
                * If the image does *not* match, take the reward (as depicted
                  on your player board) matching the greek letter.
                    * **ψ**: Take 4 favor tokens.

              tile.

                  from the game.
            * **Load an offering**: Take an offering of the color of your
              Oracle die and place it on your ship. You must have space on
              your ship to do this.
            * **Make an offering**: (deliver the cube) Place an offering of
              a color matching the die used from your ship and place it
              on a matching adjacent temple island.

                  dark clouds at the bottom of the track).
    - name: End of the Game
      id: game_end
      text: |
        The game end is triggered when 1 player completes all their Zeus
        tasks and returns to the Zeus space (starting shallows).

        * You must use an Oracle die of any color or the Poseidon action to
          move onto Zeus' space.
        * Finish the current round so that all players have equal turns.
        * After reaching Zeus, unused Oracle dice and god actions should
          be used to draw Oracle cards (tie-breaker).
        * Gods reaching the top-most row after your last turn **cannot**
          be used.

        If only 1 player completed their tasks and returned to Zeus, they
        win.  If more than 1 player did this, break the tie via the
        following (in order):

        1. The player with the most unused Oracle cards.
        2. The player with the most unused favor tokens.
        3. If still tied, the players share the victory.
