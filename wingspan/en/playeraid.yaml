          The game is played over 4 rounds, with players taking turns in
          clockwise order until all their action cubes are used (a round).

          On a turn, you have 4 options for the actions you can take.
      sections:
        - name: Play a Bird
          text: |
              1. Select a bird in hand to play and place an action cube at the
                 top of the column where you will play the bird.
              2. Pay any egg cost for that column by discarding the
                 designated number of eggs from any bird on your player
                 mat.
              3. Pay the food cost for the bird as is listed in top left by
                 returning these tokens to the supply.
                  * If there is a "â¦¸" symbol, there is no food cost.
                  * If there is a ![wild](/static/img/wingspan/wild.png)
                    symbol, any food token can be used.
                  * If there is a "/" separating multiple food tokens,
                    any of the specified tokens can be used.
              4. Place the bird on the leftmost exposed (no bird there) slot
                 in the corresponding habitat shown in the top left of the
                 card, then move your action cube to the left side of the
                 "play a bird" row.
                  * If multiple habitats are shown, you can choose which
                    habitat, of those shown, to place the bird in.
              5. If a bird has a "when played" power, you may use that power
                 now.  Other powers are activated at other times.
        - name: Gain Food
          text: |
              1. Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed (no bird) slot
                 in the "gain food" row and gain the amount of food shown
                 from dice you select in the bird feeder.
                  * Remove the die from the bird feeder when selecting that
                    food.
                  * If the die shows ![food](/static/img/wingspan/food_die.png)
                    on it, you may take **1** of the pictured items, **not
                    both**.
                  * If the bird feeder is ever empty while choosing food,
                    throw all 5 dice back in the bird feeder.
                  * If all the remaining dice in the feeder show the same
                    face (even if it's 1 die) and you are about to gain food
                    **for any reason**, you *may* 1st throw all 5 dice back
                    in the feeder.
                      * Note that the ![food](/static/img/wingspan/food_die.png)
                        die face is unique!
                  * **There is no limit to the number of food tokens you can
                    have or in the supply.**
              2. If the slot your cube is on allows you to trade in a card for
                 food, you *may* discard a card to take an additional food die.
              3. From right to left, you may now activate [brown]!brown! bird
                 powers in the forest. All powers are **optional**.
                 To better track your activations, move the cube to each
                 card you are activating until you are done and the cube is
                 placed on the left side of the "gain food" row.
        - name: Lay Eggs
          text: |
              1. Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed (no bird) slot
                 in the "lay eggs" row and lay that amount of eggs.
                  * For each egg to be layed, take an egg from the supply
                    (color doesn't matter) and place it on any bird that is
                    not at its egg limit.
                  * Any excess eggs (all birds are full) are discarded.
              2. If the slot allows you to trade a food token
                 (![wild](/static/img/wingspan/wild.png) symbol) for an egg,
                 you *may* pay 1 food token to place 1 additional egg.
              3. From right to left, you may now activate [brown]!brown! bird
                 powers in the grassland. All powers are **optional**.
                 To better track your activations, move the cube to each
                 card you are activating until you are done and the cube is
                 placed on the left side of the "lay eggs" row.
        - name: Draw Bird Cards
          text: |
              1. Place an action cube in the leftmost exposed (no bird) slot
                 in the "draw cards" row and draw the number of cards shown
                 from either the face up cards on the tray or from the top
                 of the deck.
                  * There is no hand limit.
                  * Face up cards are **not** immediately replaced. This is
                    done at the end of the turn.
              2. If the slot allows you to trade an egg for a card, you *may*
                 discard 1 egg from any bird and draw an additional card.
              3. From right to left, you may now activate [brown]!brown! bird
                 powers in the wetlands. All powers are **optional**.
                 To better track your activations, move the cube to each
                 card you are activating until you are done and the cube is
                 placed on the left side of the "draw cards" row.
              4. Replace any taken face up cards in the tray from the top of
                 the deck.
    - name: End of Round
      text: |
          When all action cubes have been placed by all players, the round
          ends. Do the following, in order:

          1. Remove all action cubes from your player mat.
          2. Score the end of round goal for the round just completed.
              * Use 1 of your action cubes to mark your score on the goal
                card, even if it's zero points. **Note that this means
                everyone will have 1 fewer action cube for the next round**.
              * **Green** side: Place cubes in order of who had the highest
                quantity of the targeted item.
                  * If players tie, place both cubes on the tied position
                    and do not reward the next place. See [End of
                    Game](#end_game) for how these score.
              * **Blue** side: Place cubes corresponding to the quantity
                of the targeted item that each player achieved, up to the
                max of 5.
                  * **Remember to still place a cube on zero if no
                    targeted items were achieved**.
          3. Discard all face up bird cards on the bird tray and refill
             the tray from the deck.
          4. Give the 1st player token to the next person in clockwise order.

          After 4 rounds have been completed, score the following points.

          * Points printed on each face up bird on your player mat.
          * Points for each bonus card as is printed on the card.
          * Points for the end of round goals (on the goal board).
              * If players are tied on a space, add the points for the space
                + the next space and divide by the number of players 
                (rounded down) and all tied players receive that many points.
          * 1 point each for:
              * egg on a bird card
              * food token cached on a bird card
              * card tucked under a bird card

          The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the player
          with the most unused food tokens wins. If still tied, the players
          share the victory.
    - name: Bird Powers
      text: |
          * **When Activated (Brown)**: These are the powers that are activated
            when using the corresponding habitat.
              * **Cache**: This means you put a food token on the bird. You
                **cannot** spend that food token! It is worth 1 VP at the end
                of the game.
          * **Once Between Turns (Pink)**: These powers may be triggered on
            opponents' turns. You can only use a pink power **once** between
            each of your own turns.
          * **When Played (White)**: These powers may only be activated when
            the bird is played into your habitat and never again.
