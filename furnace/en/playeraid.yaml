              * A set of discs and matching colored token.
              * Gain the starting resources at the top of their Start-up card.

          an [auction phase](#auction) followed by a
          [production phase](#production).
      sections:
          - name: Auction Phase
            id: auction
            text: |
                This phase consists of the auction and the resolution
                of the auction.

                * At the beginning of the round, the 1st player cuts the deck.
                * Deal out a number of cards based on the player count:
                    * **2 players**: 6 cards
                        * **If playing with 2 players**, you will also need a
                          set of discs in a non-player color, and the die, to
                          act as a dummy player.  See the [2 player
                          mode](#twoplayer) section for more info.
                    * **3 players**: 7 cards
                    * **4 players**: 8 cards

                ### Bidding
                Players take turns in clockwise order beginning with the
                1st player.

                The player **must** place a disc on one of available company
                cards following these rules (note that some capitalists
                break these rules):

                * There **cannot** be 2 discs belonging to the same player on
                  1 card.
                * There **cannot** be 2 discs with the same value on 1 card.

                The bidding continues until all discs have been placed.

                ### Resolving the Auction
                Resolve the cards in the middle of the table from **left to
                right**.

                * Resolve the cards 1 at a time until completely resolved
                  before moving to the next card.
                * If there is no disc on the card, remove it from the game.
                * If there is at least one disc on the card:
                    * The player with the highest bid gets the card.
                    * All **losing** players take the "compensation" shown
                      at the top of the card.
                        * **Compensation**: The compensation that is received
                          is the number on the disc times whatever is shown
                          at the top.
                            * Resources: Take the number of resources multiplied
                              by the disc value.
                            * Processing: Take the processing action a number
                              of times up to the disc value.
                    * **Note**: The person who takes the card does **NOT** get
                      compensated.  They only get the card.
                * When all cards are resolved, players take their discs back.

                Players run their engine in this phase to gain or process
                resources.  This can be done simultaneously.

                The cards in each player's display are resolved with the
                following rules:

                * The cards can be activated in any order.
                * Each card can only be activated **once** per production
                  phase.
                * When activating a card, you only activate the colored
                  symbols. "Transparent" symbols are **not** activated.
                * **All** effects must be activated (that the player
                  can/wishes to activate) on 1 card before moving on to
                  another card.
                * Start-up cards allow you to upgrade another card in your
                  display if the player can pay the cost.
                    * If a card has already been resolved, and is later
                      upgraded in the same round, the player **cannot go
                      back and get the additional effect**.
                    * If a card is upgraded before being resolved, both
                      effects can be used when resolving the card.

                * Move the round marker to the next number.
                    * If the 4th round was completed, players add up their
                      money to determine final scores.
                * Pass the 1st player token to the left.
    - name: 2 Player Mode
      id: twoplayer
      text: |
          * Take a set of discs in a non-player color and the die to act as
            a "dummy" player for the game.
          * During the auction phase, **after the 2nd player's bid**, roll the
            die and place the lowest numbered "dummy" player disc on the
            card corresponding to the number (furthest left = 1, furthest
            right = 6). **Follow regular placement rules**. If the lowest
            number can't be placed on the indicated card, do the following:
              1. Proceed up in disc numbers until a disc can be placed.
              2. If no discs can be placed on the card, move to the next card
                 (to the right) and repeat step 1.
                  * If the 6th card (furthest right) cannot have a disc placed
                    on it, go to the 1st card (furthest left)
          * At the end of the auction phase, remove any cards from the game
            that would have gone to the dummy player. Note that players still
            receive compensation for those cards as normal.
    - name: Variant Rules
      text: |
          * All of the player's cards (including their Start-up cards) must
            form a horizontal chain.
          * After each auction phase, players must assign places for the
            newly received cards in their chain.
              * The relative order of the cards in the chain **must stay
                the same**.
          * In the production phase, the cards in the chain are executed **in
            order** from left to right.
