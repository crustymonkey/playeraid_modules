              * If your mag. glass is 2 rows below the top of the reach the
                top of the track, you can still buy a 2 point temple tile
                (instead of advancing on the track).
              * If your mag. glass is 1 row below the top of the reach the
                top of the track, you can still buy a 6 point or a
                2 point temple tile (instead of advancing on the track).
              * The 11 point gold tiles are *only* available from the top row.
              * Some advances on the research tracks also have "travel" costs
                that must be played.

              # Monkey Temple

              * **Setup**:
                  * Place the bonus tiles in face down stacks, 1 per player,
                    on the places shown on the track in the same manner as
                    the top row of the temple tracks in the base game.
              * All **bonus tiles are secret**. A player reaching a bonus tile
                space looks through the available tiles, chooses 1 and returns
                the rest face down.
                  * Note that it is possible to get a 2nd bonus tile from a
                    space (with your notebook) if there are still tiles
                    available.
                  * This is the same way that the bonus tiles worked in the top
                    row of the temple track in the base game.
              * *The Artifact*: This space needs a face up artifact that costs
                exactly 3 compasses.  Choose 1 randomly.
                  * When reaching this row, your mag. glass must **move**
                    through the left space and your notebook **must** move
                    through the space on the right.
                  * When reaching the artifact space, you may activate the
                    artifact as if you first bought it (without paying the
                    tablet cost).
                  * No player may take this artifact.  It always remains on
                    the board.

              # Lizard Temple

              * **Setup**:
                  * After setting out the idols, shuffle the 4 remaining idols
                    into a face down stack and place them near the 3rd row
                    from the top of the temple track.
                  * After shuffling the guardian tiles, secretly place 1
                    guardian face down on the matching space.
              * *The Guardian*:
                  * The guardian is revealed when any player reaches that row.
                  * **No one may advance past the guardian until someone
                    overcomes it**.
                  * The guardian is overcome in the same manner as other
                    guardians. i.e. it is a main action where you pay the
                    cost for it (or use a card ability).
                  * You may **not** use effects that move a guardian on this
                    guardian.
                  * If you overcome the guardian, claim it as you would
                    another guardian.
                  * At the end of the round, **if the guardian has not been
                    overcome, you receive 1 fear for each research token on
                    the space**.
