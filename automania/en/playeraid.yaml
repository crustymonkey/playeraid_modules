                * Non-corner space: you must take 1 tile from the column or row before you carry out the action. Cannot choose a row or column that has no tiles.
                * Tile must be placed in your factory or discarded.

                    * Must pay the shown cost and produce that type of car.
                    * Follow the assembly line for the type of car and decide which of the 2 markets you want to ship to. Compare the tiles the car passes through against the market’s demands to determine how many stars the car is worth.
                    * If a market shows 2 matching demands, you must have 2 matching tiles in your production line to count both, otherwise take the highest.
                    * Place the produced car on a ship space less than or equal to the car’s star value.
                    * If you produce a car with 18 or more stars, the car is immediately shipped to the market and sold. Choose the reward of any sales space for that market. Does not count towards this turn’s sales limit.
                    * May take back any cars from the ships at any time.
                    * May play exactly 1 contract card from your hand if the car meets all requirements. Show the card then place it face down to score points at the end of the game.
