      * For each player:
          * Choose a wonder tray (or pick randomly).
          * Construct your wonder as diagrammed on your tray with the
            "under construction" side face up.
          * Shuffle your deck of cards and place them face up in the holder.
          * Place your deck between you and the player on your left.
      * Shuffle the common cards and make a central deck face down. Leave
        space nearby for a discard.
      * Shuffle the progress tokens and make a face down stack.  Flip the
        top 3 face up near the stack.
      * Place a number of conflict tokens face up based on player count:
          * **2-3 players**: 3 tokens

  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over a number of continuous rounds until someone
      completes their wonder, after which the game immediately ends.

      * Your turn consists of selecting the top card of the deck to your
        right, left, or the central face down deck and placing it in your
        tableau.
          * If you have the [cat token](#blue), you can look at the top card
            of the central deck before choosing.

        text: |
          * Grey cards provide resources used to build stages of your wonder.
          * If you ever have the resources to construct a wonder stage, you
            **must** construct it. This includes the use of available [yellow
            cards](#yellow).

          ## Wonder Construction
          * You must construct your wonder top to bottom.  All stages of a
            level must be completed before building anything on the next
            level.
          * Some wonders give you an option for what to build at a level.
          * [Yellow cards](#yellow) (coins) are wild resources that can/must
            be used as any resource to build your wonder.
          * Resource requirements:
              * "2â‰ ": 2 **different** resources are required
              * "2=": 2 **identical** resources are required

          * These cards provide victory points.
          * If take a card with a cat symbol, immediately take the cat token.
              * The cat token will allow you to look at the top card of
                the central deck before selecting a card on your turn.
              * The cat token is also worth 2 points if you have at the
                end of the game.

          * When you have either 2 identical or 3 different science symbols,
            you **must** discard them and take a [progress token](#progress).
              * You may select any of the 3 face up tokens or the top token
                in the face down stack.
              * If a face up token is taken, immediately replace it.
          * Keep the [progress token](#progress) in front of you after
            taking it.
      - name: Red Cards
        id: red
        text: |
          * These cards provide shields that are used in military conflicts.
          * If you take a card with horn symbols, flip over the matching
            number of conflict tokens to their red side.  e.g. if you take
            a red card with 2 horns, flip over 2 conflict tokens.
          * When you flip the last conflict token to it's red side, a battle
            occurs at the end of your turn.

          ## Battle
          1. Each player counts the number of shields on cards, wonders, etc.
             that they have.
          2. Each player compares the number of shields with their neighbors
             and if they have more than a neighbor, they take 1 military
             victory token (3 points).
              * If players are tied, no one takes a token.
          3. All players discard any cards with a horn icon. Red cards
             without horns are kept in front of players.
          4. Flip all conflict tokens to their white side.
  - name: End of Game
