        *Note that the game ships with extra components, so you will not use
        all the components when setting up.*

        * **If playing co-op**: Setup for the oppobot is as
          follows:
            * Do not use the opposition (misogynist) deck as it will not be
              used.
            * Remove the opposition buttons as they will not be used.
            * Remove the 2 strategy cards with a â˜…, which also say "Do not
              use vs. oppobot".
            * Create the oppobot deck in the same way as the
              suffragist/opposition decks as described below, but place
              the 3 start cards face up near the completed oppobot draw
              deck.

        * Place the board.
        * The suffragist player takes:
            * 2 campaigners each in yellow and purple
            * All the cubes in purple and yellow
            * 36 green check marks
            * The purple suffragist deck
        * **If playing co-op**:
            * 1 player takes the purple tokens and the other player takes
              the yellow tokens.
        * The misogynist player takes:
            * 2 red campaigners
            * All the red cubes
            * 13 red Xs
            * The red opposition deck
        * Each player creates their draw deck (suffragist and opposition) by
          separating their decks into late, middle, early, and start.
            * The start cards will go to the players' hands.
            * Shuffle the late cards and place them on the table.
            * Shuffle the middle cards and place them on top of the late cards.
            * Shuffle the early cards and place them on top of the middle cards.
        * **If playing co-op**:
            * The purple player takes the start card and the yellow player
              takes the top card of the suffragist deck.
        * Shuffle the state deck and place 9 face up near the board.  Return
          the rest to the box.
        * Shuffle the strategy deck and place it near the board.  Reveal the
          top 3 cards of the deck.
        * Place the suffragist and opposition buttons near the board.
        * Place the blue, red, and white dice near the board.
        * Place the 6 congressional markers near the board.
        * Place the turn marker on turn 1.

    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        The game takes place over the course of up to 6 turns.  If the
        suffragist player reaches 36 check marks or the opposition player
        reaches 13 red Xs, the game ends immediately.  If this is not
        the case after 6 turns, the game goes to [Final Voting](#final).

        Each turn consists of 4 phases.

        *Editor's note: The game's rules use the concept of "turn" and "round"
        in a backwards fashion.  To alleviate confusion, this aid will be
        consistent with the rules even though they are wrong.*

        ### General Notes

        * **If playing co-op**:
            * The suffragist buttons are a pool that either player can use.
            * If the opposition plays "Anti-Suffrage Riots", each suffragist
              player discards 1 card at random, then draws a new card.
        * Buttons can always be spent to reroll dice.  However, if multiple
          dice were rolled, **all dice** must be rerolled when doing this.
        * The suffragist cubes can be mixed in a state and count together
          for green checks and/or state cards.
        * When adding cubes to a state, if the opposition has cubes there,
          each cube to be added, instead removes an opposition cube.
            * Once there are no opposition cubes, you can *add* cubes to the
              state.
        * Cubes cannot be added to a state with a green check or red X.
        * If an event instructs you to remove cubes, you do **not** add any
          of your cubes.
        * If a player adds a 4th cube of their side to a state matching
          an unclaimed state card, the player takes that state card.
            * The card is placed face up in front of the player.
            * State cards, unlike strategy cards, are **never replaced**.
            * The card is not lost even if the number of cubes in the state
              drops below 4.
        * If there are ever 6 congressional markers on the board, the
          following happens:
            * For each state with a total of 4 or more suffragist cubes (can
              be mixed color), replace the cubes with a green check mark.
            * For each state with 4 or more red cubes, replace the cubes
              with a red X.
            * After this point, any time there are 4 cubes on a state,
              the cubes are immediately replaced by the appropriate marker
              (green check or red X).
        * If there are ever 36 green check marks on the board, the
          suffragist player immediately wins.
        * If there are ever 13 red Xs on the board, the opposition player
          immediately wins.

            At the start of the game, you will have the "start" card in your
            hand. In later turns, you will have 1 leftover card from the
            previous turn.

            * Each player draws 6 cards (up to a total of 7).
            * **If playing co-op**:
                * Each player instead draws 3 cards each to bring their
                  hand totals to 4 each.
                * The oppobot skips this phase.
        - name: Strategy Phase
          text: |
            **This phase is skipped during the 1st turn of the game**.

            1. The suffragist player announces how many buttons they will
               commit to the strategy phase.  They may commit zero.
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * The yellow player makes the final decision on the
                      number of buttons to commit.
            2. The opposition player may then do 1 of 3 things:
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * Roll a 4 sided die for the opposition to determine
                      the number of buttons the opposition is committing.
                    * Regardless of the following outcomes, the suffragist
                      buttons are spent.
                * Commit zero buttons: The suffragist player spends their
                  committed buttons and takes one of the face up strategy
                  cards.
                * Commit the same number of buttons: Both players spend their
                  buttons and **no one** takes a card.
                * Commit more buttons than the suffragist: Both players spend
                  their buttons and the opposition player takes a strategy
                  card.
                    * **If playing co-op** and the number on the die is
                      higher than the suffragist commit, oppobot plays the
                      strategy card immediately for the oppobot effect.
            3. If a player takes a strategy card, it is placed face up in
               front of them and a new strategy card is drawn to replace it.
        - name: Operations Phase
          text: |
            This phase takes place over 6 rounds, with each player playing a
            card for an effect each round.  The phase will end when both
            players have 1 card left.

            * Any state or strategy cards may be played either before or after
              playing a card for one of the below effects.
                * Only **1** strategy **or** state card may be played per round
                  (for each hand card played).
            * **If playing co-op**:
                * The purple player plays the 1st, 3rd, and 5th card.
                * The yellow player plays the 2nd, 4th, and 6th card.
                * The oppobot will play a card as follows:
                    * During the 1st round of turn 1, 3, and 5, oppobot will
                      play its face up event card for its event.
                    * Otherwise, oppobot draws the top card from its draw
                      deck and plays it for either its event or campaigning
                      action.
                    * Some cards have a condition that must be met to be
                      played for its event.  If the condition is not met,
                      the card is instead played for a campaigning action.
                    * If the event on the card would not have any effect for
                      oppobot, it is instead played for a campaigning action.
                    * If an oppobot card would play cubes without specifying
                      a state, roll a 6 sided and 8 sided die to determine
                      the region and state, respectively.
                        * If all states in a region have a red X or green
                          check, then re-roll the 6 sided die to determine
                          a different region.
                        * When a 4th red cube is placed in a state, oppobot
                          claims that card and immediately plays it for its
                          oppobot effect.


            When playing a card, you have 4 different actions you can take:

            1. Play the card as an event: Read and resolve the event text on
               the card.
                * Some cards have a prerequisite that must be met in order to
                  play the card as an event.
                * Some cards have a cost (usually buttons) that must be paid
                  to play the card as an event.
                * Some cards require a successful die roll.  If the die roll
                  fails, the card is discarded for no effect.
                * Some cards are persistent, either for the course of the turn,
                  the rest of the game, or during final voting. If this is
                  the case, place the card in it's appropriate spot on the
                  board.
                * If the card is not persistent, it is discarded after playing.
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * If playing an event that allows either color of cube
                      to be played, the player may place cubes of either color.
            2. Play the card for a campaigning action: Roll a 4 sided die for
               each of your campaigners on the board and assign a die to each
               campaigner.
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * The player rolls dice equal to the total number of
                      suffragist campaigners on the board, but each player
                      allocates the dice to their campaigners.
                    * When oppobot plays a card for the campaigning action:
                        * Roll a 6 sided die and move a red campaigner to
                          that region.
                        * Roll a 4 sided die to determine the number of cubes
                          to add.  Cubes are added as follows:
                            * If there is a state card in that region, the
                              cubes will be added there.
                            * If there is more than 1 state card in that
                              region, randomly pick 1 of those states.
                            * If there are no state cards in the region,
                              roll an 8 sided die to determine where the
                              cubes are placed.
                            * If placing cubes causes a red X to be placed,
                              place the remaining cubes in adjacent/close
                              states.
                        * If there is a 2nd red campaigner on the board,
                          repeat the above steps for the 2nd campaigner.
                * Each campaigner may place a number of cubes matching the
                  die roll in the region they are in.
                    * The cubes can be split between states in any way
                      you desire.
                * A button may be spent to move the campaigner to any other
                  region on the board either before or after placing cubes.
                    * **Cubes cannot be split between regions**.  e.g. You
                      cannot place 1 cube in a region, spend a button to move
                      the campaigner, and place more cubes in a different
                      region.
                * Discard the card.
            3. Play a card for an organizing action: The player takes as many
               buttons as they have campaigners on the board.
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * The player still takes buttons equal to the total number
                      of suffragist campaigners on the board.
            4. Play the card for a lobbying action: Roll a number of 6 sided
               dice equal to the number of your campaigners on the board.
                * **If playing co-op**:
                    * The player still rolls a number of dice equal to all
                      suffragist campaigners on the board.
                * For each 6 rolled, you may either add or remove a
                  congressional marker to the board.
                * Discard the card.

          text: |
            * **If playing co-op**:
                * Players may exchange their remaining card left in their hands.
                * Players may exchange state or strategy cards at this time.
            * After turns 1-5, any cards in the "rest of the turn" box on the
              board are discarded.
                * Advance the turn marker 1 space.
            * At the end of turn 6, if there were never 6 congressional markers
              on the board, **the opposition wins**.
                * If there were 6 congressional markers and no one won (36
                  check marks or 13 red Xs), proceed to [Final Voting](#final).
                * Discard any cards in the "rest of the turn" and "rest of
                  the game" boxes on the board.

      text: |
        This only happens at the end of the 6th turn if there are not either
        36 green check marks or 13 red Xs on the states.

        * **Note**: If there are cards in the "final voting" box on the board,
          they may change final voting rules.

        * **If playing co-op**:
            * The suffragist players will alternate choosing states (see
              below), but with the opposition choosing a state after each
              suffragist choice. e.g. purple, then oppo., then yellow, then
              oppo, then purple, etc.
            * The oppobot will always select the state with the most red
              cubes on it. If there are no more red cubes on the board, they
              select the state with the least suffragist cubes.
                * The oppobot rolls the gray 6 sided or 8 sided die during
                  final voting.

        * Players take turns, starting with the suffragist player, resolving
          states without a green check or red X.
            1. The player selects a state.
            2. Both players roll a 6 sided die.
            3. Add the number of **your** cubes on the state to the die result.
            4. Whoever has the highest total wins the state.  If there is a
               tie, the opposition player wins.
            5. If there are then 36 green checks, the suffragist player wins.
            6. If there are 13 red Xs, the opposition player wins.
