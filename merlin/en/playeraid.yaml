              * Everyone picks up and rolls their 3 personal dice and a Merlin
                die.
                  * If 3 or 4 of a kind are rolled, reroll until you do not
                    have 3 or 4 of a kind.
                  * Place your dice on your castle board.
              * Pass the 1st player marker to the next player to the left.
              * Move the game round marker to the next space.

              # Scoring After the 2nd, 4th, and 6th Rounds
              * After the scoring in the 2nd and 4th rounds, perform the
                same steps as for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th rounds above.
              * After the 6th round, proceed to the [end of game](#end_game)
                steps.

              ## Scoring Traitors
              1. You must repel the traitors you have by spending the shield
                 associated with the traitor. If you spend the shield, discard
                 the traitor back to its matching principality.
                  * If you hold Excalibur and repelled all your traitors,
                    gain 3 points.
                  * If you have multiple traitors showing the same shield,
                    you must spend 1 shield **per traitor**.
              2. Lose 3 points for each traitor you did not repel. Then discard
                 all your traitors back to their matching principality.
              3. Draw 3 new traitors from the stacks and attach them to your
                 player board.
                  * If the stacks are empty, shuffle the discarded traitors
                    to form 3 new stacks.

              ## Environs
              * For each group of connected terrain of the same type, VP are
                awarded for the most manors in that area.
                  * 1 VP per hex in the grouping.
                  * If there is a tie, divide the number of points between the
                    tied players, rounded down.

              ## Influence
              * For each principality, the player with the most influence
                scores VP.
                  * Start with the black principality and continue clockwise
                    in the scoring.
                  * The number of points is equal to the total number of
                    influence counters in that principality.
                  * If there is a tie, divide the number of points between the
                    tied players, rounded down.
              * After scoring a principality, all counters, down to 1 per
                player, are returned to the players' supplies. i.e. there
                should be a max of 1 counter per player after this step.
              * **Once per scoring**, the player with the Grail may place the
                grail in a principality where they are tied with another
                player to take all the points (tie-breaker).
                  * After the scoring of all principalities are complete,
                    the grail is returned to the player that had it.

              ## Henchmen
              * Each player gains 1 VP for each of their henchmen in a
                principality (no points for henchmen on player boards).

          The game ends after the scoring phase after the 6th round.

          Gain additional points for:

          * Each apple is 1 VP
          * Each unused staff of Merlin is 2 VP
          * Count the number of unused materials (shields, flags, and
            construction materials) and divide by 3 (rounded down) and
            score that many points.

          This module will give players a choice when resolving a mission
          card. Players will have the option to forgo points in favor of

              * The henchmen in the lower left corner of the mission card
                indicates the section of the board that will be activated.
              * A 1 point card has access to the top row ability, a 2 point
                card can choose the top or 2nd row ability. A 3 point card
                can choose any of the 3 rows.
                  * After choosing a row, place a seal over the chosen row.
              * Only 4 abilities can be activated on their module board
                (hence the 4 seals). You may **not** move already placed
                seals.
              * Abilities in the 3rd row are permanent, but **can only be used
                3 times per game** (once per scoring). Once the ability has
                been used, flip the seal over. Flip it back to face up after
                the next scoring phase.
