             row.  Fill the 6 slots with cards from the deck.
          2. Shuffle the *Locations* deck and place it in the middle row.  Take
             6 cards from the top of the deck to fill the 6 slots.

          5. Advanced Setup:
              1. Shuffle the *Goal* tokens and take 4 at random
                 and place them on the goal spots in any order.

          number of *additional actions*.  These can be done in any order.

                * During your turn, you **must** play 1 of the character cards
                  from your hand.
                    * If you can perform all of the card's effects, **you must
                      do so**. You may still play the card if you can't use all
                      the effects.
                * After playing the character card, put it in your personal
                  discard pile face up.

            text: |
                * **Flipping Mantas**: You can use a ready manta to resolve it
                  and flip it to its used side.
                * **Exploiting Locations' Depths**:
                    * **Resources**: You can only gain resources (coins and
                      power) during your main action.

                    * You can only exploit the top depth that is show on a
                      location card.
                    * Empty depths are blocked until you use a *raise* effect.
          - name: Effects
            text: |
                An effect can be gained by playing a character card, using a
                Manta, or exploiting depths.

                * **Recruit**:
                    1. Choose 1 character from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of coins show below the card and **put
                       it in your hand**.
                    3. Slide the other characters to the left and turn over the
                       top card from the deck to fill the space.
                * **Buy Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the number of coins shown at the top of the card.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Conquer Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of power shown at the top of the card.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Raise Location**:
                    1. Choose a location, or multiple locations (if the effect
                       is more than 1 move), and move it up the number of depths
                       specified by the effect icon.  **You do not get any
                       resources or effects from the depths you covered!**
                    2. When a location is fully risen, you receive the specified
                       wild manta if there is one on the card.  This manta
                       can be used immediately.
                * **Score** (treasure chest): This allows you to move a
                  **fully risen** location and place it in your scoring pile
                  face down.
                * **Scout**:
                    1. Take every location from the top location row and place
                       them in the discard pile.
                    2. Move every location from the bottom row to the top row.
                       If there are more than 4 locations in the bottom row,
                       discard your choice of locations until 4 remain.
                    3. Re-fill the bottom row with 6 locations.

            text: |
                If a player fulfills a goal on their turn, they can place one
                of their (their player color) mantas on the 1st available
                spot for that goal. The manta can be used or unused. **Each
                goal can only be completed once by each player**.
          - name: End of the Game
            text: |
                Players take turns until of the 3 game end conditions are met.
                When this happens, everyone (including the player who
                triggered the game end) takes 1 more turn.  Game end
                conditions:
                
                * 1 player has accomplished all 4 goals (with mantas on
                  them).
                * The location deck runs out.
                * The character deck runs out.

                Scoring is as follows:
                
                * 1 point for each character card in your hand, including
                      your king, but **not** counting those in your discard
                      pile.
                * The number of points shown above your mantas on the
                      goals track.
                * The total number of points from locations in your
                      scoring pile.  Locations on your player board do **not**
                      give you any points.

                Tie breaks:
                
                1. The player with the most mantas in their reserve.
                2. The player with the lowest number on their king card.
                3. (if not playing with kings) The last player in turn
                       order wins.
