    - name: Gameplay

          The game is played in a series of turns that are interrupted for
          *breaks*, when things are put on hold for administration, then
          resumed with the next player.

          Each turn consists of performing 1 action (which may trigger effects
          and bonuses).  The action is performed by executing one of the
          5 action cards below your zoo map.
      sections:
          - name: Your Zoo Map
            text: |
                This is where you'll build your zoo. There are some key
                things to know:

                * **You are not allowed to build on rock and water**.
                * Some animals require water or rock touching their enclosure.
                * You cannot build on ![level 2](/static/img/ark_nova/l2.png)
                  spaces until you have upgraded your build action to level 2.
                * Some spaces show a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600! bonus space, which
                  you receive when the space is covered.
                * When you support a conservation project, you will take one
                  of the player tokens (cubes) on the left side of the board
                  and place it on a Conservation card. You'll take the
                  uncovered bonus at that time.
                * Partner zoos and universities are placed on the right side
                  of your zoo map from the bottom to the top. Spaces showing
                  a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600! bonus space are activated when
                  covered.
                    * Your Association card must be upgraded to take a 3rd
                      partner zoo.
                    * Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing an
                      animal card by 3 money for matching continent icons.
                    * Universities grant the bonuses shown on the.
                * Association workers are also used from the bottom to the
                  top. When hired, they are placed standing on your notepad.
                * You may have a maximum of 5 X-tokens.
          - name: The Break Track
            id: break
            text: |
                The Break token is moved via different means during the
                game. When it reaches the last space on the track, a break
                occurs with the steps below at the end of that player's turn.
                The player that pushed it to the end receives 1 X-token.

                1. Everyone discards down to their hand limit of 3, or 5 if
                   they have the appropriate university.
                2. Remove any Multiplier, Venom, and/or Construction tokens
                   on your Action cards and return them to the supply.
                3. Everyone returns all their Association workers to their
                   notepads on their zoo maps.
                4. Replenish any missing partner zoos and universities.
                5. Discard the bottom 2 cards of the display (folders 1 and 2),
                   move the remaining cards down, and replenish the display.
                6. Take income.  Some effects (e.g. take cards from the
                   display) will require things to be executed in turn order,
                   otherwise, these items can be done simultaneously.
                    1. Collect income according to the appeal of your zoo.
                       This is indicated by the darker color above the appeal
                       spot on the board.
                    2. Take 1 money for each unique building, special
                       enclosure, **occupied** standard enclosure, and
                       pavilion adjacent to each kiosk.
                    3. Collect income indicated by the
                       ![income](/static/img/ark_nova/income.png) icon on
                       Sponsor cards and your zoo map.
                7. Return the Break token to its starting space for your
                   player count.
                8. Continue the game with the next player's turn.
          - name: Action Cards
            text: |
                The number on the slot of each action card indicates its
                strength when used. Once the action has been completed, the
                action card is removed, all cards to the left are slid to the
                right to fill the space, and removed action card is put in
                slot 1.

                * You can use X-tokens to increase the strength of the action
                  by 1 for each token used.
                    * These are returned to the supply when used.
                    * **Note**: This may allow you to increase the strength
                      of your action to more than 5!
                    * You cannot use X-tokens that would be gained from the
                      action to increase the strength of the action.
                * Some zoo cards have an effect "after finishing".  These are
                  done after the action is complete and action cards have
                  been moved.
            sections:
                - name: Cards
                  text: |
                      ## Level 1
                      **Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards
                      from the deck OR snap**.

                      * 1st advance the Break token 2 steps. If you get to
                        the end of the track, see [the instructions](#break) for
                        resolving the Break track at the end of your turn.
                      * Compare the strength of the action with the table on
                        the card to find the number of cards to draw.
                      * If you execute the action with a **strength of 5+**,
                        you may **instead** take 1 card from the display
                        (Snapping).  You may take **any card, regardless of
                        your reputation**.

                      ## Level 2
                      **Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards
                      from the deck or within reputation range OR snap**.

                      * You may draw cards from within your rep. range and/or
                        from the top of the deck (in any order).
                      * You may also snap with a strength of **at least 3**.
                        and like the Level 1 action, this allows you to take
                        any card, regardless of reputation.
                      * This will also let you progress past 9 on the rep.
                        track.

                      ## Important Notes
                      * When taking cards from the display, regardless of how,
                        **the cards are only replenished at the end of your
                        turn!**.  This is done by sliding existing cards down
                        and refilling any open spaces at the top.
                      * You may **not** look through the discard pile.
                - name: Build
                  text: |
                      ## Level 1
                      **Build exactly 1 building of your choice with maximum
                      size of <strength> on your zoo map.  Pay 2 money per
                      space.**

                      * **Available**: Kiosk, pavillion, standard enclosure,
                        and Petting Zoo.
                      * The size of the building is equal to the number of
                        spaces it covers.
                      * **Each zoo can only contain 1 Petting Zoo**.
                      * Enclosures are used to accommodate animals.
                      * Building a pavillion increases the appeal of your zoo
                        by 1.
                      * The building cost (money) is payed to the supply.
                      * The building must be built adjacent to an existing
                        building.
                          * **If it is your 1st building**, you can build it
                            such that 1 space must be on a border space.
                      * You can only build on empty spaces.  **You cannot build
                        on rock or water spaces**.
                      * You can't build on
                        [level 2](/static/img/ark_nova/l2.png) (level 2) spaces.
                      * **A kiosk must be at least 3 spaces from another
                        kiosk**.
                      * Standard enclosures are built with the empty side
                        face up.  Note that the Petting zoo is the same on
                        both sides.
                      * If you cover a space with a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600!,
                        you immediately take the bonus.
