          * **Setup**: Turn up a number of Property cards equal to the number of
            players.  These cards are then auctioned.
          * **Bidding**: The first player bids any number of their coins. Play
            continues clockwise wherein the next player must either bid or
            pass.  Note that **bidding is not required**.  A player can pass
            right away and take the lowest value card on the table (see below).
              * *If they bid*, the bid amount must be more than the previous
                bid. Bidding continues until all players have passed.
              * *If they pass*, they take the property that remains with the
                lowest value.  Then, they take back half their bid, rounded
                down and the rest is returned to the bank.  **If the person
                is the last to pass, they pay all bid money to the bank**.
              * Purchased properties are placed face down in from of the
                player.
              * The person who took the most valuable property turns over
                the next set of Property cards and begins the next auction
                by bidding (or passing).
              * Repeat until [all Property cards have been sold](#phase_2).
                Unused coins are kept by the players as they will be worth
                their face value at the end of the game.

          * **Setup**: Turn up a number of Currency cards equal to the number
            of players. Each player picks up their Property cards to form
            a hand.
          * **Play**:
              1. Each player places 1 Property card face down in front of
                 themselves.
              2. All players simultaneously reveal their Property cards.
              3. The person with the most valuable Property card takes the
                 highest Currency card.  The 2nd most valuable Property takes
                 the 2nd most valuable Currency card, and so on.
              4. Property cards are discarded from the game
              5. Flip a new set of Currency cards and repeat the auction until
                 everyone has sold all their properties.
