        text: |
          Starting with the 1st player (city crest), each player performs
          all of their actions before moving to the next player.

              * During rounds 1-3, you must fill the empty slots.
              * In rounds 4+, you **must** exchange a card in a drawer for the
                new card, discarding the old one.
              * **You may never have more than 1 copy of an ability in your

          ### Action 2: Obtain a bribe
          * Reveal the card in action slot 2, take the bribe shown in the top
            left of the card and discard the card.

          * Place 1 agent, either from your supply above your desk or from
            another location on the board, onto any building on the main board
            and **pay 2 bribes matching the color of building's background**.
              * Note that you can move agents even if you have agents in your
                supply.
              * You may only have 1 of your agents on any building.
              * Multiple players may have agents on the same building.
              * **If you now have agents surrounding a secret info. tile** (1
                agent on each connected building), immediately collect that
                tile and place it near your player board.
                  * Gain the number of points shown on the space (2/3/4).
                  * It is possible to collect more than 1 secret info. tile
                    by placing a single agent.
                  * Surrounding an empty square gains you nothing.
              * (*Advanced*) You may take **1** mission **or** resolve any/all
                missions with a flag matching the building where you placed
                your agent.

                    2 coins for a "B" mission. Then replace the mission from
                    the appropriate stack.
                  * To resolve a mission, you must show that you have all
                    the displayed requirements, but you **do not spend them**.
                      * You may resolve multiple missions.
                      * The same bribe/secret info. token can be used for
                        multiple missions.
                      * Gain the reward(s) shown in the upper right of the

                          * If you have the cash box, gain 1 additional coin,
                            which **must** be placed under the cash box.  If
                            the cash box already has the max of 12 coins, you
                            do **not** get this bonus.
                          * If you have the seal, gain 3 additional points.
          * (or) Take any 2 identical bribes from the supply.
              * (*Advanced*) You may take 2 coins instead of 2 bribes.

          ### Action 4: Move 1 Secret Info. Tracking Token
          * Move the secret info. tracking token on the secret info. board
            1 space to the right matching the token shown in the upper right
            of the card in action space 4.
              * When any tracking token crosses a threshold for the **1st
                time in a round**, move the investigator 1 space on the roof
                track and flip the investigation tile to its opposite side.
                  * (*Advanced*) If the investigator lands on a space with
                    a purchase/payday tile, place it on the investigator
                    tile as reminder for [phase 2.5](#phase25).
          * Gain 1 point for each secret info. token in your supply matching
            the moved tracking token.
              * **Important**: You get these points for each space you move
                a tracking token during your turn (for matching tokens in your
                supply). This is often due to abilities on cards.
              * If a tracking token is in the last space of its track, it is
                not moved any further, but you still score points.
      - name: "(*Advanced*) Phase 2.5: Purchase or Payday"
        id: phase25
        text: |
          * This phase is done in player order.
          * The last space has 2 tiles on it. Resolve the purchase tile 1st
            (2nd to last round) and the payday tile in the final round.

          ### Purchase Tiles
          During a purchase phase, players can make **exactly 1 purchase**:

          * Hire 1 agent for 1 coin, taking 1 of your agents from the
            next-door house and adding it to your personal supply.
          * Buy your telephone fo 2 coins. A player with their telephone
            draws **4** cards in [phase 1](#phase1). Only 3 cards are played,
            with the 4th being discarded.
          * Buy your road map for 2 coins. A player with their road map can
            use bribes as coins (1 to 1) for purchases and paying agents.
          * Buy your cash box for 2 coins.
              * Players can hide coins under the cash box instead of in plain
                view. **This can only be done when obtaining the money**. You
                cannot add coins later.
              * The cash box can hold a **max of 12 coins**.
              * Players with a cash box receive 1 extra coin when resolving
                a mission, even if the mission does not reward coins. This
                coin **must** be placed under the cash box.
                  * If you have reached the max of 12 coins in your cash box,
                    you do **not** get this 1 coin bonus.
              * Money in the cash box cannot be used for purchase/payday.
              * Each coin in the cash box is worth 2 points at game end.
              * Bribes **cannot** be put in the cash box.
          * Buy your seal for 2 coins. A player with a seal gains 3 additional
            points when resolving a mission, even if the mission does not
            grant points.
          * Buy your side table for 3 coins.
              * Place it on the right side of your desk.
              * This provides a 4th space for missions.
              * This also provides a 4th drawer for abilities.

          ### Payday tiles
          * Players must pay 1 coin for each of their agents on the game board.
              * If you cannot pay for all agents, remove any unpaid agents
                from the board.
              * Players **must** pay for their agents. Money cannot be held
                back to voluntarily remove agents.
              * Reminder: A player with a road map may use bribes instead of
                coins to pay for agents.
                  * Players are **not** required to use bribes to pay for
                    agents if they are out of coins.
      - name: "Phase 3: City Crest"
        text: |
          * Flip the investigator tile to the side without an "X" on it (if
            applicable).
          * The 1st player passes the city crest to the left.
          * If the investigator has reached the game end space on the roof
            track (see table below), play 1 more round and proceed to [final
            scoring](#scoring).
              * Otherwise, return to [phase 1](#phase1).
              * In the very rare case that all tracking tokens have reached
                the 6th space, **this will also trigger the game end** (play
                1 more round).
              * (*Advanced*) Each player removes 1 agent from the main board
                for each unresolved mission they have.

          2. The player with the most bribes.
          3. Add the points of the tied players' ranks and divide them
             equally (rounded down).

      | 3 | 12 pts. | 6 pts. | 0 pts. | - |

      1. (*Advanced*) The player with the most money on their desk.
      1. The player with the most bribes wins.
      2. (Introductory only) The player with the most agents on the main
         board wins.
      3. The player later in turn order wins.
