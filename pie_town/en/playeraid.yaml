                    from their break room onto an action space
                2.  After all workers have been played, workers are returned
                    to the break room and levels are adjusted.
                3.  Return the remaining ingredients in the orchard to the bag

                      the worker die level**.

                      Pies of the following types can be baked (in addition

                      for all the pies.  Do **not** reveal which ingredients

                      **cannot** add pies to a column if it would exceed the
                      max for the player count:

                      * 4 players: 5 pies/column

                      Each player **earns 1 VP for each pie baked**.  If the
                      player has upgraded their kitchen, **the receive 2 VPs
                      for each pie baked**.

                      you bake **at least 2** pies at a time*.
