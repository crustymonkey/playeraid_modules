    text: |
      The official suggestion is to use the instructions in the web app
      available at
      [freelancersgame.com](https://https://www.freelancersgame.com/).

      * Place the location book with room for it to be opened.
      * **Do not** shuffle the story card deck!  Place them near the location
        book.
      * Shuffle the treasure cards and place them in a stack near the location
        book.
      * Shuffle the follower cards and place them face down near the location
        book.
      * Place all the luck, stress, lock, and corruption tokens near the
        location book.
      * Each player:
          * Selects a character standee and collects its matching
            influence marker and species sheet.
          * Takes a job sheet so they can combine it with their
            species sheet to create their character sheet.
          * Should give their character a name, answers the question
            about their character, and fills out the story blanks section.
          * Retrieves their starting weapon card and places it in their
            weapon slot at the bottom of their character sheet. (There is
            a matching species illustration on the back of the card)
      * Assign all 7 [roles/responsibilities](#roles) to the players.  If
        playing with less than 7 players, some players will have multiple.
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        The app will direct you to turn to a page in the location book. When
        you have turned to the page, play will take place over a round
        consisting of [3 phases](#phases).

        ### Winning and Losing ###
        There are 3 ways the game can end.

        * **Party too wounded**: If enough wound tokens have been removed from
          the wound track on the medic board (revealing the game over space),
          all players lose and enter the code on the medic board.
        * **Party disbands**: If the threat dial ever reaches the game over
          space, the party disbands and everyone loses.  Enter the code listed
          on the lookout board.
        * **Quest goal reached**: If an entry states that players have
          completed the quest, the game is over. The more experience each
          player gained during the game, the better their personal ending
          will be.  Each player should read their personal ending out loud.
          The player with the most titles should write their character's name
          on the pipes.

        ### Saving the Game ###
        Players will have opportunities during the game to save it.

        * Players need to fill out the saved game information on the back of
          their species sheet.
        * A player will have to fill out the saved game information on the
          back of the map sheet.
        * When you want to return, open the app and follow the instructions
          listed there.

            ## Planning Phase ##
            * This is triggered when you turn to a new page in the location
              book.
            * The round timer is started immediately.
            * Players take turns placing their standees on an action space
              in influence order (highest to lowest).
            * If the timer runs out before the last player has placed
              their standee, choose 1 player to gain 1 stress and then
              continue selecting actions until all players have picked
              an action.
                * Note that players should *not* spend time reading the
                  entire action and should just place based on the
                  action's symbol.

            ### Actions ###

            | Symbol | Action |
            | ------ | ------ |
            | ![unlimited](/static/img/freelancers/unlimited.png) | Any number of players may place their standee on these actions. |
            | ![limited](/static/img/freelancers/limited.png) | Only 1 player may choose this action. |
            | ![locked](/static/img/freelancers/locked.png) | Locked actions cannot be chosen. |
            | ![required](/static/img/freelancers/required.png) | Required actions **must** be chosen by exactly 1 player.  If 1 or more required actions are still available before the last player(s) have chosen an action, those players **must** choose a required action. |

            ## Action Phase ##
            Each player will resolve their chosen action during this phase.

            * Actions are resolved in numerical order.
            * If there are multiple people on an action, they are resolved in
              influence order.
            * Follow the action's instructions to resolve it.
            * After resolving the action, the player should take their standee
              back.

            ## End of Round Phase ##
            * Enter the number listed under the current page's Round End
              section in the app and follow the instructions in the app.
            * When turning to a new page:
                * Remove all tokens from the current location.
                * Once you have the new page open, do **not** pause to review
                  it, but instead immediately start a new Plannning phase
                  (start the timer and select actions).
            * If instructed to "begin a new round on this page", immediately
              go into a new round without removing any tokens.
        - name: Skill Checks
          text: |
            Do the following when prompted to make a skill check.

            1. Take the d20 and the bonus die indicated by your current level
               (no bonus die if you have no points in that skill) for the
               skill you are checking.
            2. Roll the dice and add their values.
            3. Add any modifiers you have for that skill (usually on treasure,
               story, and follower cards).
            4. Check the text for the skill check and resolve the option
               for your total.

            The following tokens affect your skill checks:

            | Symbol | Description |
            | ------ | ----------- |
            | ![corruption](/static/img/freelancers/corruption.png) | **Corruption tokens**: If you have 1 or more corruption tokens, do **not** roll your bonus die when making a skill check.  After resolving that skill check, discard 1 corruption token. |
            | ![luck](/static/img/freelancers/luck.png) | **Luck tokens**: After rolling a die, or dice, for a skill check, you may discard a luck token to reroll 1 die. This can be done multiple times on a single skill check. |
            | ![help](/static/img/freelancers/stress.png) | **Help from a friend**: After rolling a die, or dice, for a skill check, you may request aid from other players.  Any other player may gain 1 stress to allow you to reroll 1 die. Players may do this multiple times for the same skill check. |
        - name: Spending Time
          id: sp_time
          text: |
            When the game instructs you to spend 1 time, the scout must draw
            a random token from the time bag and resolve it according to the
            following.

            | Symbol | Description |
            | ------ | ----------- |
            | ![risk1](/static/img/freelancers/risk1.png) | Add the token to the risk track. If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
            | ![risk2](/static/img/freelancers/risk2.png) | Add the token to the risk track, then draw and resolve another token (the ⊕ symbol indicates this).  If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
            | ![wound](/static/img/freelancers/wound.png) | This is treated as a risk token and added to 1 of the risk tracks. If the matching risk track is full, advance the threat dial and add the token on that space to the bag.  Then return all tokens on both threat tracks to the bag. |
            | ![follower](/static/img/freelancers/follower.png) | Enter the code on the back of the token into the app. |
            | ![supplies](/static/img/freelancers/supplies.png) | When supplies are gained, they are added to the bag.  When drawn, they are added back to the supply (not the bag) and no other effect happens. |
            | ![threat](/static/img/freelancers/threat.png) | Resolve the effect indicated on the token. |

            ### Threat Tokens ###

            | Symbol | Description |
            | ------ | ----------- |
            | ![threat1](/static/img/freelancers/threat1.png) | All players lose 1 luck token, then remove this threat token from the bag. |
            | ![threat2](/static/img/freelancers/threat2.png) | All players gain 1 corruption, then remove this threat token from the bag. |
            | ![threat3](/static/img/freelancers/threat3.png) | Treat this as a risk token that can be added to either risk track. |
            | ![threat4](/static/img/freelancers/threat4.png) | Treat this as a risk token as described above. |
            | ![threat5](/static/img/freelancers/threat5.png) | Treat this as a risk token as described above. |

            When you are instructed to reduce risk, the player may choose a
            token on either risk track and return it to the bag.
    - name: Traveling on the Map
      text: |
        When instructed to travel on the map, do the following:

        1. Players decide where they will go next by selecting a path that
           connects their current location to a new location.
        2. [Spend 1 time](#sp_time).
        3. The cartographer crosses out the party's current location, draws
           a line to the next location and circles the new location.
        4. The game master then taps the location button on the app that
           matches the new location.  Follow the instructions in the app.

        ### Backtracking ###

        * The party may select a path they've previously traveled to an
          already visited location.
        * [Spend 1 time](#sp_time)
        * Do **not** visit that location again! Instead, the party **must**
          continue traveling to another space.
    - name: Resolving Other Game Effects
      text: |
        ### HP, Stress, & Wounds ###
        * When a player gains stress, they take that from the supply and cover
          an available heart on their character sheet.
            * A player cannot willingly gain stress if they have no open hearts.
        * When a player gains a wound, the wound is removed from the wound
          track and placed over a heart on their character sheet.
            * If all the player's hearts are covered, add the wound to the
              time bag instead.
        * When a player is instructed to heal a HP, the player discards either
          a wound (back to the wound track) or stress token (back to the
          supply).

        ### Gaining Skill Points ###
        * When a player gains a skill point, that player fills in the left-most
          unfilled box in the skill row on their player sheet and gains any
          rewards that were on that space (XP or gold).
            * If all the boxes are already filled for that skill, the player
              gains nothing.

        ### Gaining XP ###
        * When a player gains XP, the player filles in the next star (top to
          bottom) on their level track.  If the star has a game effect, the
          player immediately resolves that effect.

        ### Gaining Titles ###
        * When instructed, the player writes a gained title on their player
          sheet in the titles section and circles the type of title it is
          (lawful or chaotic).
        * When a player gains their 4th or 8th title, they also gain 1 XP.

        ### Gaining/Losing Influence ###
        * The influence track is adjusted by the influencer to reflect the
          new influence when players gain/lose influence.
            * Influence markers never share a space or have empty spaces
              between them.
            * If a player at the top of the track gains influence, they may
              instead discard 1 corruption.

        ### Gaining/Losing Luck ###
        * When a player gains luck, they take 1 token from the supply.
        * When a player loses luck, they return 1 token to the supply.
        * A luck token can be discarded to reroll 1 die.
