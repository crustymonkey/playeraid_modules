  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over a series of rounds where players try and
      determine the culprit, gaining points in the process.  The winner will
      be the player with the most points, usually the player who finds the
      culprit. The culprit is determined by finding the monk with the correct
      5 traits.

      ### Monk Traits

      | Characteristic | Variations | Card Counts |
      | -------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
      | **Order** | Templar, Franciscan, Benedictine | 8 cards of each |
      | **Title** | Father, Brother, Novice | 6, 9, 9 cards respectively |
      | **Hood** | hooded, unhooded | 12 cards of each |
      | **Facial Hair** | bearded, clean-shaven | 12 cards of each |
      | **Girth** | fat, thin | 12 cards of each |

      ## Turns
      Turns are played in clockwise order consisting of the following steps.

      1. (1st player only) Move the mass bell 1 spot to the next number. If
         the bell is already on "4", move it off the card and call
         [mass](#mass) and apply the mass card's effect.
          * If this is the 1st turn of the game, place the bell in the "1"
            position.
          * If this is after the completion of [mass](#mass), move the mass
            card that was just executed to the bottom of the deck, then
            place the bell in the "1" position.
          * **If playing with 6 players, the mass bell starts on the "2"
            space** instead of the "1".  This means there will only be 3
            turns between each [mass](#mass).
      2. Move your pawn 1 or 2 (or 3 with 6 players) steps in any direction
         to another room on the board.
          * Rooms are delineated by the color the room's floor.
          * The movement is **mandatory**.
          * You cannot use a 2 step move to return to your starting room.
      3. If your pawn ends in a room with another player's pawn, you must
         ask that player a [question](#question).
      4. Perform any actions relevant to the room your pawn is now in.

        id: question
        text: |
          * If your pawn ends its movement in a room with another player,
            you must ask that player a question.
          * The person being questioned has 2 choices:
              1. Make a vow of silence by putting a finger to their mouth and
                 declining to answer.
              2. Answer the question, which entitles them to ask the questioner
                 a question of their own.
                  * After getting their answer, the original questioner
                    **must** answer the question they receive.
          * All questions **must** be answered truthfully.
          * You may ask any kind of question, as long as it doesn't have to
            be answered with a suspect's name.
              * Specific names *can* be part of the question though.
          * Example questions:
              * "How many bearded monks do you have in your hand?"
              * "Do you have the ‘Father Sergio’ card?"
              * "How many Benedictines have you crossed out from your
                suspects’ list?"
              * "Have you eliminated ‘Father Bruno’ from your list of
                suspects?"
              * “Are you going to Chapter Hall?” (Obviously, your opponent is
                then bound by his answer)
      - name: Mass
        id: mass
        text: |
          Mass takes place at the end of 4 turns (movement of the bell).
          During mass:

          1. The pawns of all players are placed in the chapel (Ecclesia).
          2. Each player simultaneously passes the number of suspect cards
             indicated on the mass card to the player on their left.
              * If a player does not have enough suspects, they give all they
                can. They still keep what they receive.
          3. Draw an event card, read it aloud, and immediately apply its
             effects.
              * Some events will have you roll a die to determine a specific
                player or room.
          4. The 1st player gives the deck of mass cards and the bell to the
             player on their right (last player).
