            * Each player must take the following 3 actions in their described order.
            * Play 1 of the cards from your hand. If all spaces within the building are occupied, treat this card as a wild card and place in any building. Playing as a wild card does not trigger the Relatives rule.
            * Place 1 of your pieces on an open space in a building whose number matches that on the card you played.
            * Draw a card from the deck.

            - name: Relatives Rule
              text: |
                * If you add a piece to a building that already contains 1 or more pieces, regardless of colour, you may choose to put additional pieces (relatives) in different buildings as part of your move.
                * You get a number of relatives equal to the number of pieces that are in the same part of the building you just placed in, not including the piece you just placed.
                * Each relative must be placed into either:
                    * A different building of the same colour.
                    * Another part of the same building (if it has multiple parts).
                    * A neutral (beige, non-numbered) building.
                * You many only put 1 relative into any building (regardless of number of parts) in any given turn.
                * Placing relatives does not trigger the Relatives rule again.
                * Cannot place relatives if there are no valid spots.

                * All players immediately discard all of their cards and return all remaining pieces to the box (not volcano).
                * Starting with the next player clockwise from the person that triggered the eruption, perform these steps until there are 6 lava tiles on the board:
                    * Draw a lava tile from the bag and place it onto the board.
                        * If you drew a dual vent tile (symbol on both sides), choose which symbol to use.
                        * If this is the first tile for a symbol, place it on the symbol’s starting space.
                        * Subsequent tiles of a symbol must be placed orthogonally adjacent to another tile with a matching symbol.
                    * If a tile is placed on a space that contains pieces, the pieces are thrown into the volcano.
                * After 6 lava tiles are draw, move on to Phase 2.

              text: |
                * Draw a lava tile from the bag and place it orthogonally adjacent to another tile with the same symbol.
                    * If this is the first tile of a symbol, place it on the symbol’s starting space.
                    * If you drew a dual vent tile (symbol on both sides), choose which symbol to use.
                * If a tile is placed on a space that contains pieces, the pieces are thrown in the volcano.
                * Throw pieces into the volcano if they are blocked from exiting the city by lava tiles, even if they can still move.
            - name: Move Your Pieces
              text: |
                * Move up to 2 different pieces of your colour.
                * Total number of pieces in a square determines how many spaces that piece can move.
                * May move fewer spaces if desired. Pieces may only move orthogonally but cannot move back-and-forth.
                * No limit to the number of pieces that can be in any square.
                * Moving through a gate costs 1 point of movement and saves the piece, placing it in front of yourself.
                * If a player only has 1 piece left in the city, they may use both of their movements to move the same piece twice.
                * If a piece is alone in its square at the start of your turn, you may move that piece twice instead of moving 2 different pieces. It will move only 1 space on the first turn; second turn is determined by number of pieces in the space it starts the second movement in.
                * If you have no pieces left in the city, you skip the Move your Pieces step.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
        * Game ends when the last lava tile is drawn from the bag or no pieces remain on the board. Finish your turn then end the game.
        * All pieces remaining on the board are thrown into the volcano.
        * Winner is the person who saved the most pieces of their colour.
        * Break ties with fewest pieces in the volcano.
