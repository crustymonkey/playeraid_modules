          Dinosaur Island is played over a number of rounds until the end game
          is triggered.  Each round has 5 Phases.

                the top of the research center with 1 die per slot.</p>
                <p>In turn order, each player assigns one of their scientists
                to one of the action spaces (below) or passes.  Continue until
                each player has had 3 turns. <b>Note that only 1 scientist can
                be assigned to each slot!</b></p>
                <p>After all players have had 3 turns in this phase, take the
                die with the most threat pips and move it to the <i>holding
                area</i> in the top right corner. If no DNA dice were
                unclaimed, no die is moved.</p>

                      In turn order, players score 1 VP for each surviving
                      patron at an attraction or dino exhibit.  <b>Do not
                      score</b> hooligans or visitors at the entrance.
                      <b>For each patron at a food attraction</b>, you choose
                      to either score 1 VP <i>or</i> collect $2.
