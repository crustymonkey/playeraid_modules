          * Players should choose their [vagrants](#vagrants)
              1. Take:
                  * The vagrant card
                  * A humanity token
                  * Your 3 matching coins
                  * 2 Starting skills (see [vagrants](#vagrants))
              2. Place the humanity token on the max humanity
              3. Place your starting skills in the matching spaces (denoted by
                 the "diamond" on the cards).
          * Place the junk cards near the board.
          * Place the haint effect tokens near the board.
          * Place all the rummage tokens in the bindle (bag).
          * Follow the setup instructions for the chosen scenario.
          * Place any remaining event tokens near the board.

          At the beginning of a round, the vagrants determine the order in
          which they will take turns.  Each vagrant turn is followed by a
          [haint turn](#haint_turn).

                * For each coin, the character can move their designated number
                  of spaces.
                * Movement is always orthogonal.
                * Movement may be split between other actions. e.g. With a
                  move value of 3, the character could move 1, investigate,
                  then move the remaining 2 spaces.
                * Vagrants cannot move through terrain.
                * Vagrants can move through spaces with a haint, vagrant, or
                  tokens.
                * Vagrants cannot end their movement on spaces with the haint
                  or other vagrants.

                A full explanation of rummage tokens and their rules is
                [here](#bindle).

                * Draw 1 rummage token per coin placed on this action.
                    * No matter how many tokens were drawn, **only 1 token is
                      kept**.
                    * Unkept tokens are returned to the bindle.
                * The rummage value on the player card is the maximum amount
                  of tokens a player can have.
                    * If a player goes over their threshold, return tokens
                      **to the bindle** until they are at their max.
                * If event tokens are drawn from the bindle:
                    * Resolve the event immediately.
                    * If multiple event tokens are drawn, resolve them in order
                      from lowest to highest.
                    * After resolving the event(s), draw a replacement rummage
                      token.
                * A rummage token may be used immediately after drawing, but
                  remember that you can only use **1 rummage token per round**.
                * Rummage tokens are discarded to the cycle track after use.
                    * If this meets the threshold for the token's limit on
                      the cycle track, [cycle the track](#cycling).

            id: investigate
            text: |
                * A vagrant in the same space as an event token can investigate
                  it.
                * Roll a number of dice equal to the number of coins on the
                  action.
                * For each coin placed on the action, roll a die.
                * 1 success is added for each die meeting/exceeding the
                  investigate value on the character sheet. See the rules for
                  [booming boxcars](#bb) if a 6 is rolled.
                * Most events will normally need 0-2 successes.
                * Regardless of success or failure, read the associated event
                  text in the scenario book.
                * Discard the event token if the event was successful, unless
                  otherwise stated in the event text.  Generally, events stay
                  on the board if the success criteria was not met.
                * "Moments" are like events, but are in the back of the rule
                  book.
                * Event tokens on tracks (round, break, etc.), they are
                  triggered when the marker enters (or moves past) its space.
                * Event tokens may be drawn from the bindle, see
                  [the bindle and rummage tokens](#bindle) for more info on
                  this.

                Determine the haint's target in the following order:

                1. **Special priority**: The vagrant with the Special Target
                   Priority token.
                2. **Action specific**: The vagrant or (non-candle) token that
                   is considered the target priority from an action or effect
                   in any train car. e.g. "target furthest vagrant" or "target
                   closest vagrant".
                3. **Candle**: The closest candle **in the same train car**.
                   Haints may only target a candle with an action that would
                   move them a number of spaces.
                4. **Hurt vagrant**: A vagrant with the most humanity currently
                   **lost** in the same train car, **not the vagrant with the
                   lowest humanity**.
                    * The number of wounds is ignored for this purpose.
                    * [Westbound](#westbound) vagrants are not considered for
                      this.
                5. **Nearby vagrant**: The vagrant closest to the haint in any
                   train car.
                    * [Westbound](#westbound) vagrants are not considered for
                      this.
                6. **[Westbound](#westbound) vagrants**: A
                   [westbound](#westbound) vagrant in any train car.
                7. **Recent vagrant**: The vagrant whose turn was the most
                   recent in any train car.

            text: |
                * Haints move orthogonally only.
                * Haints may move through terrain and vagrants.
                    * If a haint moves through a vagrant, they
                      [haunt](#haunted) the vagrant.
                * If the haint would end its move on a space with a vagrant,
                  the vagrant moves to an adjacent space of their choice.
                * The haint will move up to its move value so that it ends
                  in range of a vagrant.
                * The haint will move such that it haunts as many vagrants as
                  possible.
                * If the haint is already in range of a target, it moves such
                  that it haunts as many vagrants as possible and ending in
                  range of the target.
                * If the [target priority](#target_pri) is not in range, and
                  won't be after moving, the haint still moves toward the
                  target.
                    * As noted in [resolve action](#resolve), the [target
                      priority](#target_pri) may change after moving if a
                      different target is in range at that point.
                * If no range/target is specified, the haint will move towards
                  the highest [target priority](#target_pri).
                * If there are multiple paths a haint can take, always choose
                  the one that is the worst for the vagrants. If there is not
                  a potential worst outcome, players decide the path.

            [camp phase](#camp).
          * If all vagrants are [Westbound](#westbound) at the end of the
            scenario, they are defeated. Some scenarios may have other ways
            for the vagrants to be defeated. Read the Defeat Moment at the
            start of the [camp phase](#camp).

                **Reminder**: Only 1 rummage token may be used per round.

                * Rummage tokens may be used at any point during a round.
                * Rummage tokens do not require coins.
                * A rummage token may be used immediately after drawing it on
                  a vagrant's turn.
                * Rummage tokens are discarded to the cycle track after use.
                    * If this meets the threshold for the token's limit on
                      the cycle track, [cycle the track](#cycling).
                * Rummage tokens may be traded/given to an adjacent vagrant.
                    * **Trading/giving is considered to be "using" the token
                      for that round**.
                * If event tokens are drawn from the bindle:
                    * Resolve the event immediately.
                    * If multiple event tokens are drawn, resolve them in order
                      from lowest to highest.
                    * After resolving the event(s), draw a replacement rummage
                      token.

                | ------ | ---- | ------ |
                | ![nails](/static/img/vagrantsong/nails.png) | **Iron Nails** | Target a haint within range 2 to have the haint gain 2 humanity. |
                | ![candle](/static/img/vagrantsong/candle.png) | **Candle** | The candle is placed in an open, adjacent space. A candle **in the same train car** becomes the haint's highest [target priority](#target_pri). Once the haint moves onto the candle, the haint ends its movement and the candle is discarded. After the movement, the haint targets a vagrant in range. |
                | ![salt](/static/img/vagrantsong/salt.png) | **Salt** | When used, the vagrant may ignore the effects of a haint's action that targets the vagrant. Salt does not nullify a haint's move, haunted effects, or effects that target another vagrant. |
                | ![rabbit foot](/static/img/vagrantsong/rabbit.png) | **Rabbit's Foot** | The rabbit's foot is treated as a 4th coin. This is discarded after use. |
                | ![apple](/static/img/vagrantsong/apple.png) | **Apple** | The vagrant using the apple may flip a wounded skill card face up so it can be used again. |

                Booming boxcars (commonly referred to as "exploding dice") is
                a concept wherein, when dice are rolled, if a 6 is rolled, an
                additional die can be rolled.

                * This can be repeated as long as a 6 keeps getting rolled.
                  All the successes are counted.

                  effect.
                * Haint effects are removed in the way defined in the given
                  scenario.
                * If negating a haint effect requires discarding a rummage
                  token, only the player with the token may discard it to
                  negate it. e.g. Vagrant 1 cannot discard a token to remove
                  a haint effect from vagrant 2.

                Both vagrants and the haint (zero by default) have a humanity
                value. You are generally trying to restore humanity to the
                haint to win a scenario.

                ## Vagrant Humanity
                If a vagrant's humanity reaches zero:

                * The vagrant suffers a wound, returns their humanity back to
                  their max and either:
                    * Flips a skill card to the wounded side **OR**
                    * Flips a junk card to its broken side.

                If a vagrant would reach zero and all of their junk/skills are
                flipped to broken/wounded, they become [Westbound](#westbound).

                ## Haint Humanity
                * If the haint's humanity reaches the humanity threshold
                  (breaking the haint):
                    * Any additional humanity the haint would have gained is
                      **lost**.
                    * Move the marker up 1 space on the break track. Resolve
                      any events on the space. See the [investigate
                      action](#investigate) for more info on resolving events.
                        * If the marker would move off of the 1 space, the
                          haint has been saved and (usually) the vagrants have
                          won the scenario.
                    * Reset the humanity tracker to zero.
                    * **The haint does not take its next turn!**
                    * **All vagrants gain 1 humanity**.

                If all of a vagrant's skills and junk are flipped to their
                wound/broken side, the vagrant becomes Westbound and does the
                following:

                * Discard any haint effect tokens.
                * Flip your vagrant card to the Westbound side.
                * Place your humanity token on the 1 space.
                * Keep any rummage tokens.
                * Place your character's Westbound skill **on top of** 1 of
                  your skill cards.
                    * Note that this skill will be lost if the vagrant is
                      still Westbound at the end of the scenario (below).
                * **A Westbound vagrant cannot lose humanity if they only
                  have 1 humanity**.
                * Westbound vagrants cannot perform skills, even if they are
                  healed, but can do general actions.
                * If a vagrant is ever told to flip their card to the
                  Westbound side, flip all their skills to wounded and junk to
                  broken.
                * If all vagrants are Westbound at the end of a scenario,
                  read **Moment 13**.
                * If a vagrant is Westbound at the start of the [camp
                  phase](#camp), they must permanently discard the skill
                  they placed their Westbound action on.
                    * If they became Westbound multiple times during the
                      scenario, they still only discard 1 skill.
                    * The discarded skill may be wounded or normal.
                * If a Westbound vagrant would lose humanity and their
                  humanity is greater than 1, they may instead have the
                  closest, non-Westbound, vagrant lose the humanity instead.
                * When a Westbound vagrant regains all their humanity (during
                  the scenario or during the [camp phase](#camp)):
                    * They flip over any 1 of their wounded skills to the
                      normal side.
                    * They flip over their character card.
                    * Place the humanity token on the max value.
                    * Set aside the Westbound action card.

              * Players collaboratively decide how to spend their coin pool.
              * All coins from each vagrant plus any earned from rituals are
                available to use.
                  * Players may also discard any broken junk to get 1 coin per
                    discarded junk.
                  * Any coins not spent will be lost.
              * Coins can be spent on the various actions:
                  * **Acquire new skills**: (2 coins) There are 2 skills
                    available per scenario. The new skill is added to a slot
                    for the chosen vagrant. If skills are acquired via Moments,
                    they do not cost coins.
                  * **Heal a wound/fix junk**: (1 coin) Wounds and broken junk
                    can be healed/fixed for 1 coin per item.
                  * **Rummage**: (1 coin) Players may rummage 1 (as normal)
                    to acquire rummage tokens that can be brought into the
                    next scenario.
                  * **Acquire junk**: (3 coins) Shuffle the junk deck for your
                    current tier (tier 1 at the start of the game) and draw
                    the top card. This can be purchased for 3 coins.
                      * Any replaced junk can be put in the groups belongings.
                      * Only 1 junk can be purchased per camp phase.
                  * **Draw different junk**: (1 coin) Vagrants may put the
                    offered junk on the bottom of the deck and draw a new junk.
                    This can, again, be acquired for 3 coins.
                  * **Perform a seance**: (1 coin per vagrant) Vagrants may
                    gain the seance card for use in the next scenario. The
                    seance is used per the scenario rules.
                  * **Bank coins**: (1+ coins) Mark off the number of banked
                    coins on page 41 of the rule book, or your campaign sheet
                    (see Mile Posts below for a link to download the sheet
                    for printing), as boxes in the appropriate location on
                    the sheet from left to right.
          2. Save game (optional)
              * Keep the skill and junk cards associated with each vagrant for
                use in the next scenario.
                  * Wounded skills and broken junk stay in the same state.
          3. Manage vagrants
              * Vagrants may switch out skills and/or junk as long as they
                have space in the appropriate locations for said items.
              * Personal skills may be swapped in out for each vagrant at this
                time.
              * Personal belongings, like group belongings, are unlimited.
              * A new vagrant can chosen during this phase.
                  * Permanently discard any exclusive skills for your current
                    vagrant.
                  * Starting skills are not permanently discarded and may be
                    used if a player switches to this vagrant later.
                  * Choose any non-wounded skill/unbroken junk to keep for the
                    new vagrant.
                  * Choose a new vagrant that is not [Westbound](#westbound) and
                    gain that vagrant's starting skills.
              * **At this stage, a new player can be added to the group**.
                  * They take the character's starting items and may also take
                    skills/junk from the group's belongings.
          4. Witness the In-Between
              1. Return any pooled coins to each vagrant.
              2. Draw the top card from the In-Between deck and read the story
                 out loud. *The In-Between deck should be in numerical order
                 and never be shuffled*.
              3. Each player **secretly** chooses one of the available
                 reactions.
                  * Each player will place a coin with their choice face down
                    (A for choice A, etc).
              4. After all players have chosen, flip the In-Between card and
                 each player resolves their results individually.
          5. Start the next scenario
              * Players should progress to the next scenario per their victory,
                defeat, or the In-Between card.
