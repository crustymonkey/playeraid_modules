    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
          The game is played in a series of turns that are interrupted for
          *breaks*, when things are put on hold for administration, then
          resumed with the next player.

          Each turn consists of performing 1 action (which may trigger effects
          and bonuses).  The action is performed by executing one of the
          5 action cards below your zoo map.
      sections:
          - name: Your Zoo Map
            text: |
                This is where you'll build your zoo. There are some key
                things to know:

                * **You are not allowed to build on rock and water**.
                * Some animals require water or rock touching their enclosure.
                * You cannot build on ![level 2](/static/img/ark_nova/l2_build.png)
                  spaces until you have upgraded your build action to level 2.
                * Some spaces show a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600! bonus space, which
                  you receive when the space is covered.
                * When you support a conservation project, you will take one
                  of the player tokens (cubes) on the left side of the board
                  and place it on a Conservation card. You'll take the
                  uncovered bonus at that time.
                * Partner zoos and universities are placed on the right side
                  of your zoo map from the bottom to the top. Spaces showing
                  a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600! bonus space are activated when
                  covered.
                    * Your Association card must be upgraded to take a 3rd
                      partner zoo.
                    * Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing an
                      animal card by 3 money for matching continent icons.
                    * Universities grant the bonuses shown on them.
                * Association workers are also used from the bottom to the
                  top. When hired, they are placed standing on your notepad.
                * You may have a maximum of 5 X-tokens.
          - name: The Break Track
            id: break
            text: |
                The Break token is moved via different means during the
                game. When it reaches the last space on the track, a break
                occurs with the steps below at the end of that player's turn.
                The player that pushed it to the end receives 1 X-token.

                1. Everyone discards down to their hand limit of 3, or 5 if
                   they have the appropriate university.
                2. Remove any Multiplier, Venom, and/or Construction tokens
                   on your Action cards and return them to the supply.
                3. Everyone returns all their Association workers to their
                   notepads on their zoo maps.
                4. Replenish any missing partner zoos and universities.
                5. Discard the bottom 2 cards of the display (folders 1 and 2),
                   move the remaining cards down, and replenish the display.
                6. Take income.  Some effects (e.g. take cards from the
                   display) will require things to be executed in turn order,
                   otherwise, these items can be done simultaneously.
                    1. Collect income according to the appeal of your zoo.
                       This is indicated by the darker color above the appeal
                       spot on the board.
                    2. Take 1 money for each unique building, special
                       enclosure, **occupied** standard enclosure, and
                       pavilion adjacent to each kiosk.
                    3. Collect income indicated by the
                       ![income](/static/img/ark_nova/income.png) icon on
                       Sponsor cards and your zoo map.
                7. Return the Break token to its starting space for your
                   player count.
                8. Continue the game with the next player's turn.
          - name: Action Cards
            text: |
                The number on the slot of each action card indicates its
                strength when used. Once the action has been completed, the
                action card is removed, all cards to the left are slid to the
                right to fill the space, and removed action card is put in
                slot 1.

                * You can use X-tokens to increase the strength of the action
                  by 1 for each token used.
                    * These are returned to the supply when used.
                    * **Note**: This may allow you to increase the strength
                      of your action to more than 5!
                    * You cannot use X-tokens that would be gained from the
                      action to increase the strength of the action.
                * Some zoo cards have an effect "after finishing".  These are
                  done after the action is complete and action cards have
                  been moved.
            sections:
                - name: Cards
                  text: |
                      ## Level 1
                      **Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards
                      from the deck OR snap**.

                      * 1st advance the Break token 2 steps. If you get to
                        the end of the track, see [the instructions](#break) for
                        resolving the Break track at the end of your turn.
                      * Compare the strength of the action with the table on
                        the card to find the number of cards to draw.
                      * If you execute the action with a **strength of 5+**,
                        you may **instead** take 1 card from the display
                        (Snapping).  You may take **any card, regardless of
                        your reputation**.

                      ## Level 2
                      **Advance the Break token 2 spaces. Then draw cards
                      from the deck or within reputation range OR snap**.

                      * You may draw cards from within your rep. range and/or
                        from the top of the deck (in any order).
                      * You may also snap with a strength of **at least 3**.
                        and like the Level 1 action, this allows you to take
                        any card, regardless of reputation.
                      * This will also let you progress past 9 on the rep.
                        track.

                      ## Important Notes
                      * When taking cards from the display, regardless of how,
                        **the cards are only replenished at the end of your
                        turn!**.  This is done by sliding existing cards down
                        and refilling any open spaces at the top.
                      * You may **not** look through the discard pile.

                      ## Level 1
                      **Build exactly 1 building of your choice with maximum
                      size of <strength> on your zoo map.  Pay 2 money per
                      space.**

                      * **Available**: Kiosk, pavillion, standard enclosure,
                        and Petting Zoo.
                      * The size of the building is equal to the number of
                        spaces it covers.
                      * **Each zoo can only contain 1 Petting Zoo**.
                      * Enclosures are used to accommodate animals.
                      * Building a pavillion increases the appeal of your zoo
                        by 1.
                      * The building cost (money) is payed to the supply.
                      * The building must be built adjacent to an existing
                        building.
                          * **If it is your 1st building**, you can build it
                            such that 1 space must be on a border space.
                      * You can only build on empty spaces.  **You cannot build
                        on rock or water spaces**.
                      * You can't build on
                        ![level 2](/static/img/ark_nova/l2_build.png) (level 2)
                        spaces.

                      * **A kiosk must be at least 3 spaces from another
                        kiosk**.
                      * Standard enclosures are built with the empty side
                        face up.  Note that the Petting zoo is the same on
                        both sides.
                      * If you cover a space with a [**yellow ⬠**]!#d5d600!,
                        you immediately take the bonus.

                      ## Level 2
                      **Build as many different buildings as you like
                      with a maximum total size of <strength> on your zoo
                      map**.

                      * **Newly available**: Large Bird Aviary and the Reptile
                        House.
                          * If built, you may **immediately** move animals
                            from standard enclosures to the the new building.
                              * **You are not allowed to do this at any other
                                point in the game**.
                      * **Each zoo can only contain 1 Reptile House and 1
                        Large Bird Aviary!**
                      * This action does **not** allow you to build *unique
                        buildings*, those come into play via Sponsor cards.
                      * You can now build more than 1 building with 1 action.
                        **You can not build 2 identical buildings though**.
                        The total size cannot exceed the <strength>.
                          * Each building should be built in its entirety
                            before building the next building, which includes
                            taking bonuses.
                          * Note that any "after finishing" bonuses only
                            trigger at the end of the Build action.
                      * You can now build on
                        ![level 2](/static/img/ark_nova/l2_build.png) (level 2)
                        spaces.
                      * **If you cover every space in your zoo**, not including
                        water/rocks, **immediately increase the zoo appeal
                        by 7**.

                      ## Level 1
                      **Play Animal cards from your hand**.

                      * Compare the strength of the action with the table on
                        the card to determine the number of cards that can
                        be played.

                      1. Check the conditions on the left side of the card
                         to make sure you meet them.
                      2. Pay the cost to play the animal in the upper left of
                         the card.
                          * **If you have a partner zoo matching the continent,
                            pay 3 less per continent icon**.
                          * If the card gives you money for playing the animal,
                            you can **not use this money to pay for the
                            animal**.
                      3. Fill an empty enclosure.
                          * The standard enclosure must be at least the size
                            required by the animal (upper left of card). Flip
                            the enclosure to its occupied side. **Make sure
                            any water/rock requirements are met for the
                            enclosure**.
                          * Petting zoo animals can **not** be put into a
                            standard enclosure.
                          * All reptiles and birds can be put in the Reptile
                            House and Large Bird Aviary, respectively.
                      4. Place the animal card next to your zoo map.
                      5. Execute all effects.
                          * Increase your appeal as indicated on the card.
                          * Check for any conservation project points or
                            reputation increases on the card.
                          * If the text effect says "after finishing", do this
                            after you've completed your Animals action.  **All
                            other effects on the card should be finished before

                      **Perform exactly 1 association task**

                      * You need at least 1 unused worker to perform this task.
                      * Place the worker on Association board. If 1 of **your**
                        workers is already on the task, you must place **2
                        workers** to perform the task. **If 3 of your workers
                        are already on the task, you cannot do this task**.
                      * Make sure you have the required strength for the task.
                      * **Str. 2**: Increase the rep. of your zoo by 2.
                      * **Str. 3**: Take a partner zoo from the association
                        board and place it in the lowest empty space on your
                        zoo board.
                          * You can **not** take a partner zoo you already have.
                          * **Your association action must be level 2 to take
                            a 3rd and 4th partner zoo.
                          * Each partner zoo reduces the cost of playing
                            Animal cards matching the continent by 3 money per
                            continent icon on the card.
                          * Some animals *require* a partner zoo.
                      * **Str. 4**: Take a university from the board and place
                        it on your zoo map in the lowest spot.
                          * Take bonuses and advance your rep. counter if
                            shown on the university.
                          * You can **not** take a university you already have.
                      * **Str. 5**: You may either support a project already
                        in play or play a Conservation project card from your
                        hand and support that.
                          * If you play a new project card, place it **above**
                            the Association board in the leftmost space. If
                            there is a project there, slide all projects to
                            the right first.
                              * If there are more projects than you can
                                have for your player count (1 per player),
                                discard the right-most card.  Tokens on the
                                card are returned to players' **supplies**.
                          * To support a project, you must fulfill the
                            requirement for the space on the card.
                          * **You can not support a project that already
                            has your token on it**.
                          * The token to cover the space on the project card
                            comes from the left hand side of your zoo map,
                            **not your supply**.  Take the uncovered bonus
                            immediately.
                          * Take any additional bonuses shown on the project
                            card.

                        workers necessary for **each task**.
                      * The total value of all tasks can not exceed the
                        strength of the action.
                      * For Conservation projects, you may play a project
                        directly from the display within your reputation
                        range.  **You must pay an amount of money equal to

                        at the end of your turn.
                      * **In addition** to association task(s), you may make
                        1 donation.  Pay the smallest amount of money in an
                        uncovered space and cover the space with a token
                        **from your supply**, not your zoo map.  Gain 1
                        conservation point.
                          * If all spaces are covered, additional donations

                      **Play exactly 1 Sponsor card OR advance the Break token

                        and then place it next to your zoo map.

                        the Break token <strength> steps and take <strength>
                        money for doing so. You always take <strength> money
                        regardless of how far the Break token moves.

                      ## Level 2
                      **Play 1 or more Sponsor cards OR advance the Break
                      token and take money**

                      * The strength of your action **plus 1** must be at
                        least as high as the sum of the levels on played cards.
                      * If you play multiple cards, you complete everything
                        on 1 card before moving on to the next.
                      * If cards have "after finishing" in the text, this is
                        executed after your entire action is complete.
                      * You may play Sponsor cards from the display within
                        your reputation range. Pay an **additional** amount

                        do another action, you can use this to take 1 X-token.
                          * This is performed using any Action card, but the
                            strength isn't used.
                          * Move the selected action card to slot 1 and adjust
                            the other cards as normal.

          ## End of Game Trigger
          * The game end is triggered if, at the end of a turn or during a
            break, a player's Conservation and Appeal counters are ever in the
            **same scoring area**.  Note that there are multiple appeal spaces
            in most conservation areas.
          * If the end of game is triggered at the end of your turn, all
            **other** players get 1 final turn, **but not you**.
          * If the end game is triggered during a break, **all** players get
            1 final turn.

          ## Final Scoring
          * **If no player reached 10 conservation points, all players should
            discard one of their Final Scoring cards now**.
          * Gain any conservation or appeal points from Final Scoring cards.
          * Gain any conservation or appeal points from any cards with the
            hourglass (also, brown stripe in the top left) symbol on them.
          * Your final score is your appeal value minus the **lowest appeal
            value** in the space your conservation token exists. This means
            your score **may be negative**. The person with the highest score
            wins.
              * If there is a tie, the tied player who supported the most
                Conservation projects wins. (Count the number of missing tokens
                from the left side of player boards)
              * If there is still a tie, the players share the victory.
