                    advance it 1 space on its track.
                  * Note that if the eagle is on the last space, it

                from your player board.
              * *Resourcefulness* card: Your options on the card depend on

                    depicted on your player board.
              * *The Suitcase*: The suitcase icon with a token means that you
                should place these items in your suitcase instead of your
                general personal supply (like the setup for rounds 2-5 as
                described under Setup above).
                  * Tokens in your suitcase can **only** be used to buy
                    artifacts. Compasses for the initial purchase, and tablets
                    to pay the cost when playing an artifact later.
                  * At the beginning of rounds 2-5, you should take the token
                    from above the card row for the current round and add it
                    to your suitcase.

                  * Any artifact in your play area counts, including 1 you
                    purchased this round or 1 spent for its travel value.
                      * Artifacts in your *archive* do **not** count.
              * *Archive*: When you buy an artifact, you may buy from the card
                row *or* your archive.
                  * The **1st time** your archive is empty, add a compass to
                    your suitcase and refill your archive with 3 new cards
                    from the top of the deck. **This can only be done once

                  * If you use a snack token for these cards, place it on
                    the card in your play area. **This snack token cannot
                    be used to reuse your archaeologist** this round.
                      * The token remains in your play area for the rest of

                can be used multiple times in a round.
                  * To reuse an archaeologist, take a snack token from your
                    player board, pay the cost shown on it (if any), flip it
                    over and place it on the site you are leaving.
                  * **You can never move your archaeologist to a site with a
                    snack token on it** (previously visited during that round).
                    This also applies to spaces for 2 archaeologists.
                      * Other players ignore your snack tokens (non-blocking
                        for them).

                (instead of advancing on the track).

              * **Setup**:
                  * Place the bonus tiles in face down stacks, 1 per player,
                    on the places shown on the track in the same manner as
                    the top row of the temple tracks in the base game.
              * All **bonus tiles are secret**. A player reaching a bonus tile
                space looks through the available tiles, chooses 1 and returns
                the rest face down.
                  * Note that it is possible to get a 2nd bonus tile from a
                    space (with your notebook) if there are still tiles
                    available.
                  * This is the same way that the bonus tiles worked in the top
                    row of the temple track in the base game.
              * *The Artifact*: This space needs a face up artifact that costs
                exactly 3 compasses.  Choose 1 randomly.
                  * When reaching this row, your mag. glass must **move**
                    through the left space and your notebook **must** move
                    through the space on the right.
                  * When reaching the artifact space, you may activate the
                    artifact as if you first bought it (without paying the
                    tablet cost).
                  * No player may take this artifact.  It always remains on
                    the board.

              # Lizard Temple

              * **Setup**:
                  * After setting out the idols, shuffle the 4 remaining idols
                    into a face down stack and place them near the 3rd row
                    from the top of the temple track.
                  * After shuffling the guardian tiles, secretly place 1
                    guardian face down on the matching space.
              * *The Guardian*:
                  * The guardian is revealed when any player reaches that row.
                  * **No one may advance past the guardian until someone
                    overcomes it**.
                  * The guardian is overcome in the same manner as other
                    guardians. i.e. it is a main action where you pay the
                    cost for it (or use a card ability).
                  * You may **not** use effects that move a guardian on this
                    guardian.
                  * If you overcome the guardian, claim it as you would
                    another guardian.
                  * At the end of the round, **if the guardian has not been
                    overcome, you receive 1 fear for each research token on
                    the space**.

              # Waterfall Temple

              * **Setup**:
                  * Place the 2 waterfall tiles on the left of each pair
                    of matching spaces on the board.
                      * Covered costs do not apply.
                      * When the space above the tile is researched, slide
                        the tile to the left/right to cover the old cost
                        and reveal the new one.
                  * Deal level 1 site tiles equal to the number of players
                    randomly face down to the matching space on the board.
              * There is a shortcut high on the left side of the board
                (the 10 point mag. glass space) that can be used to go
                directly to the temple by paying its cost (arrow, ruby, and
                an unused idol).
              * Only your mag. glass may go to the space with the face down
                level 1 sites.
                  * When reaching this space, look through all the site tiles,
                    select 1, and activate it.  Then place it on the bottom
                    of the matching site stack.

              # Tree Temple

              * **Setup**:
                  * It is recommended to cover the snake temple side of the
                    board with this.
                  * **Before dealing idols to sites**, make 2 face down
                    stacks of randomly chosen idols (1 per player) and place
                    the stacks in their spaces in the right hand column of
                    the board.
              * When you reach an idol chamber with your mag. glass, you may
                place 1 of your unused idols in 1 of the slots for that
                space and gain the depicted reward.
                  * If you do not have an idol to place (or choose not to), you
                    gain no reward.
              * When you reach an idol chamber with your notebook, look through
                the stack of idols, choose 1 and return the remainder face
                down. Gain both the reward on the selected idol and the idol
                itself.
