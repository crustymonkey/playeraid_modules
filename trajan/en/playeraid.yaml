            * Move the time marker forward a number of spaces equal to the number of action markers being moved.

                    * Play 1 or 2 cards from their hand face up in front of themselves to their personal display. These may be worth points for some bonus tiles. The player then draws a number of cards from the face down draw pile equal to the number of cards they played.
                    * Ship commodities by playing cards to your personal display. The played cards must match a combination found on one of the ships. Score points equal to those found on the ship. If the ship is colored side up, flip it over to its gray side after scoring.

                        * Subsequent workers of theirs must be placed orthogonally adjacent to another of their workers.
                        * If there is a tile on this location, the player takes it and places it on their mat. If this is their first tile of that type, immediately perform the assigned special action.

        * Players lose points if they cannot meet all of the demands based on the number of unmet demands:
            * 1: -4 VP, 2: -9 VP, 3: -15 VP.
        * Each player counts their number of votes in the senate + votes from senate tiles on their mat. Ties are broken by whomever is further up on the senate track. Further ties are broken by which disc is on top.
        * The player with the most votes chooses one bonus tile and takes it yellow side up.
        * The player with the second most votes takes the remaining tiles and places it gray side up.
        * Return all vote discs back to the start space of the senate track with the fewest votes on the bottom and most votes on top.
