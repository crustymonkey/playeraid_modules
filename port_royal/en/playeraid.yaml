        * If playing with less than 5 players, remove the special Expedition
          that is 5 players only (only card **without** a coin on the back).
        * Shuffle the remaining cards and set them face down.
        * Deal 3 "coins" to each player face down from the draw pile.  This is
          their personal display
        * **Note**: Each time a player gains coins, draw the appropriate
          number of cards from draw pile and place them face down with
          every coin visible in your display, but don't look at the front of
          the card.  Each card == 1 coin.
        * The player who last visited a harbor is the start player.

        Players take turns being the *active player* with each turn consisting
        of 2 phases, where sometimes the 2nd phase will be skipped.  If there's
        a 2nd phase, then **after the active player**, each other player
        may also act in that phase.  Then the active player changes.

        If the draw pile is ever empty, shuffle the discard to create a new
        draw pile.

              * The active player draws a card to place in the middle of the
                table, forming the "harbor display".
              * The player repeats the draw of cards until they either stop or
                2 identically colored ships are in the harbor display.
                  * **Stopping**: Proceed to [phase 2](#phase_2).
                  * **"Busting"**: Drawing 2 ships of the same color **that
                    cannot be repelled** will end the player's turn.
                      * Discard all of the harbor display (except Expeditions)
                        and move to the next player's turn.
                      * All players with a Jester in their personal display gain
                        1 coin.
              * There are 4 different types of cards that behave differently:
                  * **Person**: If you draw a person, it goes into the harbor
                    display (row of cards in the middle of the table). Each
                    person has an ability at the top of the card. It will also
                    have a shield with a number of victory points.
                  * **Ship**: These can be added to the harbor display or
                    repelled.
                      * **Repelling**: If you have enough Swords on
                        sailors/pirates **in your personal display** >= the
                        number of swords depicted on the ship, you can repel
                        it. If you do this, put the ship in the discard pile
                        *instead of* into the harbor display. If you don't
                        have enough swords, it **must** go into the harbor
                        display.
                          * You may only repel a ship that has just been drawn.
                          * Swords are never spent, they can be used multiple
                            times during your turn.
                      * If you choose not to, or cannot, repel the ship, add it
                        to the harbor display. **If this is the 2nd ship of a
                        particular color, you have busted**. See "Busting"
                        above for the process there.
                  * **Expedition**: Put these cards in the middle of the table,
                    but **separate from the harbor display**. These will stay
                    where they are until a player claims it.
                      * To claim an epedition, the player must have people
                        with matching symbols >= to what is shown on the bottom
                        of the expedition card.
                      * The person cards used to take the expedition **are
                        discarded**.
                      * Take any gold show at the top of the expedition card.
                      * Expeditions may be claimed at any time during a player's
                        turn. Any number of expeditions may be claimed.
                  * **Tax Increase**: If this is drawn, all players that have
                    12+ coins, lose half (rounded down) of their coins.  Put them
                    in the discard pile.
                      * After coins are discarded, resolve the bottom of the
                        tax increase with rewards based on what is shown.  Ties
                        are friendly, so all tied players get the reward.
                      * After resolving the bottom of the card, the tax increase
                        is discarded.

            id: phase_2
            text: |
              In this phase, the active player will take 1-3 cards from the
              harbor display, then **all other players, in clockwise order,
              will have a chance to take 1 card**.

              * The other players must pay for the card as normal
                (if applicable, see below).
              * Additionally, the other player **must pay the active player
                1 coin to do this**.
              * If a ship is taken, the coin(s) on the ship can be used to
                pay the active player.

              The number of cards the active player can take is based on
              ships in the harbor display.

              | Ships | Cards |
              | ----- | ----- |
              | **0-3 differently colored ships** | take 1 card |
              | **4 differently colored ships** | take 2 cards |
              | **5 differently colored ships** | take 3 cards |

              Cards are taken 1 by 1, so the ability of 1 card may be available
              for the next cards.

              * **Trade**: The player takes 1 ship from the harbor display,
                puts it in the discard pile, and gains the coins shown at the
                top of the card.
              * **Hire**: The player pays an amount of coins equal to the
                cost in the bottom part of the person card. Then, they put the
                person into their personal display. The ability at the top
                of the card is **immediately available for use**.
    - name: End of Game
      text: |
        * As soon as 1 player acquires 12 points in their personal display,
          the end is triggered.  The round is finished such that everyone
          has the same number of turns.
        * If there is a tie in points, the player with the most coins left wins.
        * If there is still a tie, the players share the win

        ### End of Game Variant
        * The game end is triggered when 1 player has 12 points **and at least
          1 Expedition** in their personal display.
        * All other rules are the same.
