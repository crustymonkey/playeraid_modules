      The game is played over 8 rounds and each round consists of 3 steps.
      The steps are all performed simultaneously, but all players must
      finish a step before moving on to the next step.

          1. Draw 2 energy cards from your deck and place them face up
             near your player board.
          2. Place energy cubes on each card matching the number of energy
             cube symbols on each card.
          3. Secretly assign 2 of your 5 phase cards that you wish to perform
             and place them face down underneath your chosen energy card.
              * Each phase is performed at a specific energy amount, which
                is used to determine the actions you can perform. The energy
                card will contribute to total energy with which you perform
                a phase.
              * All players must assign cards **before moving to the next
                step**.
          4. Flip the assigned phase cards face up.
          5. **If playing with 2 players**, reveal the next unrevealed phase
             card in the middle of the table and place the energy cube(s) on
             the matching phase.
          6. Move all energy cubes onto the matching phase spaces of the
             main board.

        id: rphases
        text: |
          All players simultaneously complete each phase that they are
          able to perform.

          ### Phase Rules
          * You perform a phase only if you assign that phase card during
            [round preparation(#prep) **or** an energy cube is placed on
            the relevant space on the main board.
          * You will perform at least 2 phases, and maybe more depending
            on where energy cubes are placed.
          * When performing a phase, always determine [total energy](#tenergy)
            1st. [Total energy](#tenergy) cannot be modified retroactively.
          * Phases are always performed in the same order, starting with
            upgrade and ending with recycle (as printed on the central board).
              * You should mark the current phase you are working on by
                moving it into the relevant section of your player board.
          * Each phase must be fully completed before moving to the next phase.
              * All actions within a phase are optional.
          * Players may complete phases independently. e.g. Player 1 could
            still be working on the upgrade phase while player 2 has moved on
            to the assemble phase.

            text: |
              * To unlock an upgrade token:
                  1. Pay the upgrade cost.  You can choose a combination
                     of energy and resources as printed on your player
                     board.
                      * If performing multiple upgrades, the same
                        combination can be chosen more than once.
                  2. Remove an upgrade token from your player board back
                     to your supply.
                      * If you remove an upgrade token from the upgrade
                        section of your player board, immediately gain
                        [inspiration](#inspire).
              * You place an upgrade token from your supply onto a robot,
                class, or inventor card with the matching upgrade type
                at **any** time during the game to gain special
                actions/effects.
                  * Once an upgrade token is placed, it cannot be moved.
                  * Upgrade tokens are limited.
          - name: Assemble
            id: assemble
            text: |
              * To assemble a robot:
                  1. Choose a robot card from your hand and place it on
                     your player board.
                      * A robot card must always be placed in the leftmost
                        available space matching its associated phase.
                      * You may have a max of 5 robots in in any row. If a
                        row is full, you may not assemble a robot there.
                  2. Pay the resource cost.
                      1. You may choose either column in the top left part of
                         the robot card as the assembly cost.
                      2. The extra resource cost to assemble a robot is
                         printed on some spaces in your play area. You must
                         be able to pay the extra cost to assemble a robot.
                      3. Spend the energy and resources.  Any leftover energy
                         is lost.
                          * You may split energy to assemble more than 1
                            robot in a single assemble phase.

              These phases work the same way and allow you to run the
              associated phase row.

              * To run a phase row:
                  1. Do the actions shown on your player board.
                      * You may do **any/all** actions in the matching
                        phase that <= your [total energy](#tenergy).
                      * Actions must be performed 1 at a time, top to bottom
                        (on the player board).
                  2. Activate robots.
                      * You may do **any/all** actions in the matching
                        phase row that <= your [total energy](#tenergy).
                      * Actions must be performed 1 at a time, left to right
                        (on the robot cards in the row).
                      * You may only use the upgraded action if you have
                        a matching upgrade token on the robot.
      - name: "3. Round End"
        id: rnd_end
        text: |
          When all players are finished with the [round phases](#rphases), then
          all players:

          1. Perform any abilities that trigger during Round End.
              * If you have multiple, you determine the order.
          2. Discard your 2 energy cards face up next to your deck of energy
             cards. These won't be available again until a break period (see
             below).
          3. Take back both of your phase cards to your hand (you can use
             them again next round).
          4. Return energy cubes on the central board to the supply.
          5. Move the round marker 1 space.
              * If the round marker moves off the last space, the [game is
                over](#gameend).
              * If the round marker moves onto the 5th round, then immediately
                complete a break period (below).
              * Proceed to [round preparation](#prep) for the next round.
          6. **If playing with 2 players** and 4 of the phase cards in the
             middle of the table are revealed, do the following (same as
             during [setup](#setup)):
              1. Shuffle all 5 phase cards and deal them in a face down line
                 in the middle of the table.
              2. Reveal the 1st 2 cards in the line.
              3. Place 1 energy cube on the 3rd card in the line.
              3. Place 2 energy cubes on the 4th card in the line.


          ### Break Period
          * All players draw 3 new class cards, keep 1 and discard the other 2.
          * All players shuffle up all of their energy cards to form a new
            deck of 8 energy cards.
  - name: Game End
    id: gameend

      The game ends after the completion of the 8th round.

      * Add up VP from the following sources:
          * VP as printed on robot cards.
          * VP on [class cards](#classcards) based on the class grade earned
          * VP as indicated in your inventory.
          * Each battery + resources (including duct tape) + the number of
            robot cards in hand divided by 3 (rounded down) VP. e.g. If you have
            2 batteries, 2 duct tape, 3 gears, and 1 robot card, you would
            gain 2 VP (8 / 3 rounded down).

      Whoever has the most VP wins. Ties are broken by VP from robot cards in
      your play area. If still tied, the player with the most VP from class
      cards wins.  If still tied, players share the victory.

          | ![sgmp](/static/img/raising_robots/sgmp.png) | Sensors, Gears, Microchips, and Programs -- various resources. |
          | ![duct](/static/img/raising_robots/duct.png) | Duct tape can be used in place of any other resource. **Cannot be spent as a wild**. |
          | ![battery](/static/img/raising_robots/battery.png) | Batteries can be used to increase your energy when performing phases. |
          | ![robot](/static/img/raising_robots/robot.png) | Robot cards can be built or used as resource. e.g. When completing upgrades. |
          | ![wild](/static/img/raising_robots/wild.png) | Wilds represent extra benefits/costs chosen by the player. Each time you gain/spend a wild, you gain/spend a sensor, gear, microchip, program, or robot card. Duct tape **cannot** be spent as a wild. |

          ### Inventory
          * This track at the top of your player board is used to track
            the number of resources you have during the game.
          * If you have zero of a resource, place the token above the board.
          * If you have more than 10 of a resource, flip the marker to the
            +10 side.  For VP, move the large VP marker.
          * Resources are not limited by your board. If you exceed 20, keep
            track of this in some manner.
          * Robot cards are not tracked on your board.
              * There is no limit to the number of robot cards a player can
                have in hand.
      - name: Total Energy
        id: tenergy
        text: |
          To determine total energy, add up energy from the following:

          * The energy value of the energy card you assigned to the phase.
          * Each energy cube on the phase provides 1 energy (it doesn't matter
            who placed it).
          * If an energy card has an energy cube multiplier symbol, double
            the energy acquired from the energy cubes on the phase space.
            e.g. If there are 2 cubes on the phase, they would be worth 4
            energy instead of 2.
          * You may spend batteries to increase the energy value of a phase
            by 1 for each battery spent.
              * Batteries do **not** allow you to perform phases that you
                have not selected or that do not have energy cubes.  See
                also [phase rules](#rphases).
              * You must always determine total energy 1st, so
                you cannot use batteries acquire during a phase retroactively.
              * You may use batteries acquired during a phase in later phases.
          * Any upgrades you have unlocked that provide energy bonuses on
            your player board.
              * Like batteries, these do **not** allow you to perform
                phases you have not selected or do not have energy cubes.
                See also [phase rules](#rphases).
              * These will increase your energy for the matching phase (when
                performing it).
          * You may split your total energy into smaller chunks to perform
            multiple actions **only** during the upgrade and assemble phases.
              * You should use an arrow token to track your energy remaining
                when splitting it up.
      - name: Class Cards

          * If you gain [inspiration](#inspire), you may obtain a new class
            card.
              * You can only have a **max of 3 class cards**.
              * You may discard **1** of your existing class cards to take
                1 of the new cards when gaining [inspiration](#inspire).
          * Each class card to the left of your player board at [game
            end](#gameeend) will give you VP based on the grade earned.
              * To determine the grade, count the number of items that meet
                your class objective and use the table on the card to
                determine VP.
                  * Improve your class grade by 1 row if you unlocked extra
                    credit.

          ### Class Objectives
