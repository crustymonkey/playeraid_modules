                "5+" in the bottom right and place it next to the campsite
                board. Otherwise return it to the box.
              * Shuffle the rest of the campsite tiles and add 3 to the
                campsite area.  Make sure all campsites are flipped to their
                season 1 side.  Return the rest to the box.
    - name: Gameplay

          The game is played over the course of 4 seasons. **Each player has 
          a limit of 12 tokens**.  If a player has more than 12 tokens at
          the *end* of their turn, they must discard down to 12.

                * Flip the top card of the season deck and place it on top of
                  the deck.
                * Looking at the weather pattern (lower right), and starting
                  with the **2nd** trail site (not counting the trail head),
                  place tokens on the cards matching the pattern, repeating
                  until there are tokens on the remaining trail sites, but
                  **not** the trail end.
                * **If playing with Nightfall**: Once the weather is setup,
                  place the tents.
                    * Starting with the site to left of the trail end and going
                      to the left, place **3** of the tents, 1 on every other
                      site.
                        * If playing with less than 4 players, only 3 tents will
                          be used and the last tent is returned to the box.
                        * If playing with 4+ players, place the last tent in
                          between the 2 tents closest to the trail head.
          - name: Taking Turns
            text: |
                Starting with the 1st player, each player takes a turn by
                moving 1 of their hikers to a site on the trail. Play
                continues clockwise.

                * Your hiker can be moved as far along the trail as the
                  player would like, **but you must be able to take the site
                  action**.
                    * If there is another hiker (including your own) is on the
                      site, you must flip your campfire tile to the extinguished
                      side.  **If it's already on the extinguished side, you
                      cannot move to a site with another hiker!**
                * **If playing with Nightfall** and you land on a site with
                  a tent, you may take the tent and place it on an *available*
                  campsite to take that action **instead of** the normal site
                  action.
                    * You do not get the weather token if you take a campsite
                      action.
                    * See the [actions reference](#actions) for more info
                      on individual campsite actions.
                * Once you've moved to the site, you take any tokens on the
                  site, then perform the [action on the site](#actions).
          - name: Action Details
            text: |
                In addition to the [site action summaries](#actions), the
                following covers specifics for some actions.

                * **Canteens**: When you draw a canteen card, place it face
                  up with the
                  ![empty canteen](/static/img/parks/canteen_empty.png) showing.
                    * To fill the canteen, place a **gained** water token on
                      the card and perform the action.
                    * **Canteens cannot be filled with water that was not
                      received during a turn**.
                    * You may have any number of canteens.
                    * Once filled, the water remains on it until the end of
                      the season and cannot be used until the water is
                      removed.
                * **Photos and the camera**: When when choosing the
                  ![photo](/static/img/parks/photo.png) action, spend any 2
                  tokens to take a photo tile.
                    * **If you already have the camera, spend only 1 token
                      instead of 2**.
                    * After taking the photo, take the camera from whoever
                      has it.
                    * Photos are worth 1 point.
                    * The player with the camera at the end of the season can
                      spend 1 token to take an additional photo.
                    * If you have a gear card that allows you to take photos,
                      **you do not gain the camera**.
                * **Trail end**: There are 3 different action "locations" at
                  the trail end you can go to.
                    * **Reserve a park**: Choose 1 of the 3 available parks,
                      or draw 1 off the top of the deck, and place it face
                      up in front of you rotated 90° (until finished).
                        * If a park was reserved from a board slot, flip a
                          new card to replace it.
                        * If you are the 1st player to take this action, also
                          take the 1st player token. You will be 1st player
                          in the next season.
                        * Any number of players may reserve a park.
                    * **Buy gear**: You may buy 1 gear card from one of the
                      face up gear cards. Then, flip a replacement from the
                      deck for the one taken.
                        * If you're the 1st (or 2nd in a 4+ player game) to
                          take this action, also take a sun token. This can
                          be used for the purchase of the gear card.
                        * Note that some gear have ⚡ *instant* effects that
                          activate when you purchase it, in addition to the
                          ongoing effect.
                        * Any number of players may buy gear.
                    * **Visit a park**: Choose 1 of the 3 available parks on
                      the board, or one you have previously reserved, and
                      spend tokens equal to the cost at the bottom of the card.
                      Then, if a park was taken from the board, flip a new
                      card to replace it.
                        * Place the card *vertically* (to distinguish it from
                          reserved parks) in front of you.
                        * You can stack parks such that only the VP and tokens
                          at the bottom of the card remain showing.
                        * Any number of players may visit a park.
                        * **If playing with Nightfall**, if the card has an
                          ⚡ action, this can be taken **after** paying the
                          card cost.  The instant action is optional.
                        * If a card shows a
                          ![brown token](/static/img/parks/any_token.png)
                          symbol, any tokens may be used to pay the cost as
                          long as it's the correct number of tokens.
                            * Gear that provides a discount when visiting parks
                              only applies to the **specific tokens** shown
                              on the park, not the
                              ![brown token](/static/img/parks/any_token.png)
                              symbol.
                * **Campsites Actions** (Nightfall): If you stop at a site
                  with a tent token, you can optionally take the campsite
                  action instead of the normal action.  See [site
                  actions](#actions) for more info.
                    * **Camera**: If the player has the camera and visits a
                      campsite or a park that allows them to take a photo,
                      they may use *any* token to pay instead of the 1
                      depicted.
                    * **Campfires**: When visiting a site with a tent, the
                      player may choose either the campsite action or the
                      normal site action + weather token (if still available).
                    * **Gear and camping**: Gear cards that reference a
                      specific trail site still activate when a player chooses
                      to use them to camp at that site.
                    * **Wild love** (variant): 1 wildlife token counts for
                      **2** of the brown "any" tokens.  You may also turn in
                      1 wildlife token instead of any 2 tokens to take a
                      photo.

                * When a player's 2 hikers reach the trail end, they are
                  done taking turns until the season is complete.
                * When there is only 1 hiker left on the trail, they **must**
                  move their hiker to the trail end on their next turn.
                * Once all hikers are on the trail end, the season is over
                  and the following is done.
                    1. The player with the camera may spend 1 token to take
                       a picture.
                    2. All water tokens are removed from canteens and placed
                       in the supply.
                    3. Return all hikers to the trail head.
                    4. Pick up all the trail sites except for the trail
                       head/end, add an additional advanced site from the
                       face down stack, shuffle them all and place the new
                       trail. The new trail will be 1 space longer.
                    5. Remove the current season card.
                    6. Return to the instructions for the
                       [start of a season](#season_start), then begin the
                       next season starting with the player who has the
                       1st player token.
                * **If playing with Nightfall**:
                    * Remove all tent tokens from campsites and the trail.
                    * Flip any campsites so the number on the bottom left
                      corresponds to the next season.
                    * Follow the instructions for tent setup for the [start
                      of a season](#season_start).
                * If this was the end of the 4th season, proceed to [game
                  end](#game_end)
    - name: Game End
      id: game_end
      text: |
          After the photo opportunity ([step 1](#season_end)) at the end of
          the 4th season, the game ends. Now score points:

          * Points on **visited** parks, reserved parks do not score.
          * Points on your year card (personal bonus).
          * 1 point for each photo.
          * 1 point for the player with the 1st player token.
          * **If playing with Nightfall**:
              * Each year card will score, but if a player has multiple
                copies of the same year card, it only scores **once**.
              * Note that for year goals, only the symbols to the left of
                the ⚡ on the parks count.

          Whoever has the most points wins.  If tied:

          1. The player with the most visited parks wins.
          2. If still tied, the players share the victory.

          * **Can I visit a site without taking its action?**: No, you **must**
            be able to take the site action to visit a site.
          * **Can I use a token provided by the weather towards a trail site's
            action?**:  Yes.  These are collected *before* taking the site
            action.
          * **What happens if we run out of tokens?**: Tokens are limited. If
            a site would grant/make use of a token that is not available, the
            site cannot be visited.
          * **When can I fill a canteen?**: They can only be filled by a water
            acquired on a turn. You cannot use previously collected water for
            a canteen. If you can a canteen *and* a water on the same turn,
            the water can be used to activate that canteen.
          * **Does the ![1for1](/static/img/parks/1for1.png) effect count
            toward season effects?**: Yes. If you trade a token for another
            token that has a season effect, it activates it. Note that **you
            can only use the season effect once per turn**.
          * **Do actions on canteens count toward season effects?**: Yes.
          * **Can visiting the ![water
            action](/static/img/parks/water_action.png) activate gear that
            specifies a site?**: No. You may copy the effect of another site,
            but it doesn't count as visiting the copied site. However, tokens
            gained this way can be used for season effects.
          * **Can multiple gear cards like maps, compasses, and journals be
            used together?**: Yes.  The effects on these cards are cumulative.
            However, you can never reduce a cost below zero.
          * **How do sunscreen or rain gear work?**: These allow you to visit
            a park using a different type of token in place of another. This
            ability applies to the token symbols on the park card (and not
            to the discounts from other gear).
          * **How does filling a canteen for free work with the water
            bottle?**: You may take a water from the supply for free and place
            it on the canteen to activate it.
          * **How does season of rain and splendor work?**: One water or sun,
            depending on the season, is added on top of each of the 3
            available parks at the start of the season.  If a player visits
            or reserves that park, they get the token. The token gained can
            be used to pay the cost of the park. **Do not add tokens to
            parks that come out later in that season**.
