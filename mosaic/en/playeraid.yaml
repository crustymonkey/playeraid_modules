          The game takes place over a number of rounds with each person
          taking 1 of the actions outlined below until 1 of the following
          2 things occur:

          * The 3rd Empire Scoring Card is revealed **OR**
          * 2 of 3 of the following tiles have all been taken by the players:
              * Wonders
              * Civilization Achievements
              * Golden Ages

          When either of these happens, perform [Empire
          Scoring](#empire_score) and finish the round (equal turns). Then
          play 1 final round.

          **Important**: Money can be used in place of any currency (food,
          ideas, or stone) at a 2:1 rate (e.g. 2 money instead of 1 stone).

              * Produce 1 of the 3 non-money currencies in the game (ideas,
                food, or stone).
                  * Add your population to your production of that currency
                    shown on your player board to determine the number of
                    resources to take.
        - name: Population

              * Select 1 of the 2 population cards available and pay the
                number of food shown on the card. Increase your population
                on your player board by the amount shown on the card.
              * Place the used population card out of play and draw a new
                card to replace it.
              * When all cards have been used up, all future population actions
                gain 2 population costing 15 food.

          text: |
              * Select 1 of the 5 build cards, pay the cost, place the
                card in front of you, and gain the benefits shown.

                  * Note that the [pillars of civilization](#pillars) shown
                    on the card are now usable.
              * Replace the card with a new one from the deck.
              * **Building a city**:
                  * Cost: 4 stone and 2 population
                  * Place a city on any available hex anywhere on the board.
                      * Gain any trade good or cache on that space.

                      * Take the fish tile and add 3 to your food production.
                  * Regular cities/towns may **not** be built in port spaces.
                  * These act just like any other city for scoring purposes.
                  * **Place 10 money from the supply into the holding area
                    on the board**.
              * **Building a town**:
                  * There are 2 kinds of towns: farm towns and manufactory

                    on the card.

              # Cache Tiles
              Immediately take the benefit shown on the tile and return the
              tile to the box.

              # Trade Goods Tiles
              Place your trade goods tile on your player board.  If you
              end up with a duplicate, place it on top of the matching tile.

              * When playing a tariff card, part of the calculation for money
                earned is the number of unique trade goods you have.
              * Stone and grain tiles have a "+2" on them.  Add +2 to your
                production of stone or food when taken.
              * Fish tiles have a "+3" on them.  Add +3 to your food production

              * Cost: 20 stone and 5 food
                  * The cost for every wonder after the first is increased
                    by 5 stone and 5 food.  e.g. your 3rd wonder would cost
                    30 stone and 15 food.
              * Select 1 of the available wonder tiles and its matching hex
                tile.
              * Pay the cost and place the wonder tile in front of you --
                there will be points for this at the end of the game.
              * Place the hex token on any available hex in a region in
                which you have at least 1 city.
              * **Note that some wonders have placement restrictions**.  See
                the wonders section of the [quick reference](#quick) for
                details.
                  * If those restrictions cannot be met, the wonder cannot
                    be built.
        - name: Technology
          text: |
              * Cost: 5 ideas
              * Take 1 of the 5 available tech cards from the board and place
                it in front of you.
                  * If you already have the required [pillars of
                    civilization](#pillars), you may place it face up
                    and gain the benefits.
                  * If you do not own the required prerequisites, you place
                    the card face down in front of you.
              * For any face down tech card in front of you:
                  * This can be played (flipped over) on any of your turns.
                    This does **not** count as your turn action.
                  * You must have all the required [pillars of
                    civilization](#pillars) to play the card.
                  * "1x" means that this event occurs 1 time, when the card is
                    played.
                  * You are not able to use the [pillars of
                    civilization](#pillars) on the card until the card
                    is played.
                  * Once played, the card remains face up.
        - name: "Tax & Tariff"
          text: |
              * Select 1 of the 2 tax & tariff cards available and place it
                in front of you.
              * Gain the amount of money shown on the card + the money in the
                holding area from city builds.
              * These cards will increase unrest. Unrest will result in
                negative points at the end of the game.
                  * Unrest can be negated by abilities from wonders, leaders,
                    and some tech cards.
              * When all the cards from the deck have been used:
                  * All future tax actions generate 2 money/population +
                    government symbol + your tax production.
                  * All future tariff actions generate 2 money/unique trade
                    good + your cities + your tariff production.
              * **Money can be used in place of any currency (food, stone,
                ideas) at a 2:1 rate**.  e.g. you can spend 2 money instead of
                1 stone.
        - name: Military
          text: |
              A military action consists of recruiting new units and/or moving
              units on the board.

              * You can recruit new units by paying 5 money for each unit.
                  * The units you recruit can be placed in any region
                    containing 1 of your cities.
                  * You may recruit **up to 2 new units in 1 turn**.
              * You can move military units from 1 region to an adjacent
                region at a cost of 1 money for each unit.
                  * You can move any number of military units once per turn.
              * Regions that are adjacent:
                  * Italy and Numidia
                  * Italy and Greece
                  * Hispania and Numidia
                  * Numidia and Egypt
                  * **Greece is not adjacent to Egypt**
              * Military units do not occupy hexes. They exist in a region,
                but block nothing in that region.
              * Each military unit counts as 1 influence during [empire
                scoring](#empire_score).

                See the [quick reference](#quick) for more information on
                the different governments including costs and requirements.
              * You may only have 1 government at a time. If you purchase a
                new government, return the previous tile to the board.
              * If you own a government, you may flip it from the "arrow
                side" (upper right of the tile) to clear one set of offer
                cards (Build, Population, Technology, or Tax & Tariff) and
                replace them from the appropriate deck.
                  * The cleared cards are placed at the bottom of their
                    respective deck
                  * This can be used once per game per government tile.

          On your turn, if you meet the requirements for one of these tiles,
          you may claim the tile and place it in front of you.

          * This does **not** count as your action for your turn.

          When an Empire Scoring Card is revealed from 1 of the decks, the
          player who revealed it finishes their action, then scoring takes
          place.

          1. Count the influence in each region:
              * Each wonder or city you own: 2 influence.
              * Each town and military unit you own: 1 influence.
              * Note any bonuses from technologies that can change this.
          2. The player with most influence in the region scores:
              * 3 points **+**
              * 1 point per city and wonder in the region, **regardless of who
                owns them**
              * *In case of a tie*, all tied players score the above points.
          3. The player with the 2nd most influence in the region scores 2
             points.

          The game takes place over a number of rounds until 1 of the following
          2 things occur:

          * The 3rd Empire Scoring Card is revealed **OR**
          * 2 of 3 of the following tiles have all been taken by the players:
              * Wonders
              * Civilization Achievements
              * Golden Ages

          When either of these happens, perform [Empire
          Scoring](#empire_score) and finish the round (equal turns). Then
          play 1 final round.

          ## Scoring
          Total up the following.

          * All victory points accumulated during the game.
          * Every city you have on the board: 2 VP
          * Every town you have on the board: 1 VP
          * VP shown on wonder tiles
          * VP shown on golden age tiles
          * VP shown on civilization achievement tiles
          * VP equal to the number of [pillars of civilization](#pillars)
            symbols that you own of the type show on each project card
          * VP as shown on the technology cards you have played with
            the ![qvp](/static/img/mosaic/qvp.png) icon on the bottom left
          * Each manufactory town card has 3 trade goods shown on the bottom
            of the card. If you have all 3 of those trade goods on your
            player board, score 5 VP.
              * If you have 2 identical manufactory towns, **they will both
                score**.
          * Unrest: **[Subtract]!red!** the number of net unrest from your
            score
              * This is generally gained from tax and tariff cards.
              * Some wonders, leaders, and tech cards will cancel out unrest.

          The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the tied
          player with the most wonders wins. If there is still a tie, the
