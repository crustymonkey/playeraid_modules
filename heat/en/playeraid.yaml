        * Place a board of your choosing on the table.
        * Each player takes:
            * a car in their color
            * a player mat in their color
            * a gear pawn in their color
            * 12 speed cards in their color
            * 3 starting upgrade cards
        * Check the board for how many heat and stress cards to add to each
          player's deck (usually 6 heat and 3 stress).
        * Shuffle your speed cards, including the upgrades and stress cards
          and place this facedown in the draw spot on your player mat (left
          hand slot).
        * Place the 6 heat cards faceup on the engine spot in the center
          slot on your player mat.
        * Put your gear pawn in 1st gear.
        * Place the remaining stress cards near the board.
        * Randomly place the cards on the starting grid to determine player
          order for the 1st round.
        * Each player draws 7 cards from their draw deck to form their starting
          hands.

        The game is played through a number of rounds until a player has
        crossed the finish line after the final lap.  The number of laps
        is dependent on the track (printed on the board)

        * Note that the order of player turns is determined by the order of
          the cars on the track.  The 1st car will play 1st.
            * **If there are 2 cars next to each other, the car closest to the
              racing line is considered ahead for all purposes**.

        Each round consists of all players taking their turn, which will
        consist of:

        1. Adjust their gear
        2. Play cards
        3. Move their car
        4. (other intermediate steps are situational/optional)
        9. Draw back up to 7 cards

          text: |
            * You may optionally change gears.
            * You can gear up 1 or down 1 for free.
            * You *may* gear up 2 or down 2, but you must pay 1 heat to
              do so.
        - name: '2. Play Cards (simultaneous)'
          text: |
            * The number of cards you **must** play is determined by your
              current gear.  e.g. If you are in 3rd gear, you **must**
              play 3 cards.
            * Cards are played **face down** into your play area.
            * If you have so much heat in your hand that you cannot play
              the required number of non-heat cards for your gear, cover
              the difference with heat cards **and then**:
                * Your does not move this turn.
                * Move your gear to 1st gear.
                * Place the cards in your play area in your discard pile.
                * Skip straight to step 9, [replenish](#replenish).
        - name: '3. Reveal & Move (in order)'
          id: reveal
          text: |
            Each player will take turns, in car order (1st car plays 1st),
            revealing and moving their cars and optionally/situationally
            taking actions 4-8.

            * Flip all the cards you played face up.
                * If you have flipped 1 or more Stress cards, follow this
                  procedure for each Stress to determine its speed.
                    * Flip the top card of your draw deck and if it is a
                      speed card (**must** have the speedometer symbol),
                      add it to your played cards.
                    * If the flipped card is not a speed card, put it in
                      your discard pile and keep flipping cards until you
                      draw a speed card.
            * Add the values of all the cards to determine your speed and
              move your car that many spaces forward on the track.
                * Cars never prevent you from passing them, even when it
                  looks like the track is blocked.
                * If you would end your movement in a space where all the
                  spots are taken, you are blocked and must put your car in
                  the 1st open spot behind the blocking cars.
            * After completing your movement, make sure your car is as close
              as possible to the racing line.
                * If there are 2 cars next to each other, the car closest to
                  the racing line is considered ahead for all purposes.

            **This only applies if you are the last player to move, or 1 of
            the last 2 cars in a game with 5+ cars**.

            * You may add 1 extra speed (move 1 extra space) before **or**
              after your boost (see [react](#react)).
            * You also get 1 cooldown (see [react](#react)).

            Activate any symbols you have access to in any order. You might
            have access to symbols from your current gear or
            [adrenaline](#adrenaline).

            ### Cooldown
            * For each cooldown (number in the symbol), take a heat card
              from your hand and put it back in your engine (center slot).
                * Note that you get 3 cooldown in 1st gear and 1 cooldown in
                  2nd gear.

            ### Boost
            * You may boost 1x per turn to increase your speed.
                * Pay 1 heat.
                * Flip cards from your draw deck until you get a speed card
                  (speedometer) and move your card the matching number of
                  spaces. Discard all other cards drawn before the speed
                  card, similar to Stress cards in the [reveal & move
                  phase](#reveal).
        - name: '6. Slipstream'
          text: |
            **This only applies if you end your next to, or behind, another
            car**. This is optional.

            * If you choose to slipstream, you move 2 spaces forward.
            * **Slipstreaming does NOT increase your speed value for the
              purposes of the [check corner](#chk_corner) step**.
        - name: '7. Check Corner'
          id: chk_corner
          text: |
            **This only applies if you crossed through a corner this round**.

            * Check if your total speed for the round is <= to the corner's
              speed limit.  If so, nothing happens.
            * If your speed is > the speed limit, you pay heat equal to the
              difference of your speed to the corner's limit.  e.g. if the
              speed limit is 3 and you went through the corner with a
              speed of 5, you would pay 2 heat.
            * If you go through more than 1 corner on the same turn, you must
              pay for each of them separately.
            * If you do not have enough heat to pay for your excess speed,
              you spin out (see below).

            ### Spin Out
            1. Move the car back to the 1st available space before the corner.
            2. Take stress into your hand based on your gear:
                * 1st or 2nd gear: 1 stress
                * 3rd or 4th gear: 2 stress
            3. Move your gear to 1st gear.
        - name: '8. Discard (optional)'
          text: |
            * You may discard cards from your hand if you do not want to
              use them in a future round.
            * **You can never discard heat or stress cards!**
        - name: '9. Replenish Hand (required)'

          text: |
            1. Put all cards in your play area into your discard pile.
            2. Draw back up to 7 cards.
                * At any point where you would need to draw cards and your
                  draw deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a
                  new deck.
                    * If this happens mid-turn, do **not** shuffle your play
                      area into your draw deck!
            3. The next player resolves steps 3-9.
    - name: End Game
      text: |
        When the 1st player crosses the finish line after the indicated (on
        the board) number of laps, this will trigger the end game phase.

        * If more than 1 car crosses the finish line, the car that is the
          furthest ahead wins.
            * Remember that the car closest to the race line is ahead.
        * Slipstreaming is **not allowed** if you have crossed the finish
          line of the last lap.
            * **You cannot slipstream across the finish line**.
        * Remove any cars that have finished and place them on the board in
          their positions and keep playing until every car has finished.
