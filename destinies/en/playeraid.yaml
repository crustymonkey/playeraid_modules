          * Refresh 1 effort die (purple) by moving it to the supply area of
            your player board.
          * Events may be triggered at this point. If so, follow the
            instructions in the app to resolve it.
      - name: Movement
        text: |
          * You may move to a tile up to 2 tiles away.
          * All movement is made orthoganally.  You **cannot** move diagonally.
          * If you move onto an unexplored tile, your movement ends.
          * You may stay on the same tile instead of moving.
          * After moving onto an *explored* tile, you may visit 1 point of
            interest (could be a token or mini).
          * After moving onto an *unexplored* tile, tap it in the app.  Follow
            the instructions in the app, which will usually be something like:
              1. Flip the chosen tile to its explored side.
              2. Place your mini onto the tile.
              3. Place the point of interest markers on the tile.
              4. Place new unexplored tiles adjacent to the tile (unexplored
                 side face up).

          ## Submaps (Witchwood)
          * Travel to some areas is only possible via some items and
            points of interest with the "Path" prefix.

          ## Encounters (Witchwood)
          * Any time you travel, you may come upon an encounter.  Follow
            the instructions in the app to resolve these.
          * **Traveling Merchants**: These are a type of encounter.
              * You will be instructed to setup a trade stack near the board,
                but these stacks are only marked with a **single token**.  No
                token is placed on the board.
              * Traveling merchants can only be encountered when the app
                instructs you.
      - name: Visiting a Point of Interest
        text: |
          * Tap the chosen point of interest in the app to see the
            description for that point.
          * You will generally have multiple options for each point of
            interest.
              * Any/all options can be chosen in any order, but each option
                may only be picked once.
              * Some choices will end your turn.
              * Options types are listed below.

          ## Interactions
          * These will allow you to do an action without passing a test e.g.
            "pull a lever".
          * You may have a followup choice after choosing an interaction.

          ## Tests
          * There are 3 different types of tests (corresponding to the rows
            on your player board).
              * **Intelligence** (blue): Reflects cleverness, charisma, and
                wisdom.
              * **Dexterity** (green): Reflects agility and sense awareness.
              * **Power** (red): Reflects strength, health, and endurance.
          * Dice are used for tests.  Dice have the following sides:
              * **Main dice** (white): 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4
              * **Effort dice** (purple): 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, ★
                  * The ★ side represents an automatic success.
          * Any/all dice on your player board may be used for a test. Effort
            dice not on your player board are **not** available.
              * Effort dice are exhausted and placed next to, not on, your
                player board.  The die must be refreshed to be used again.
              * To resolve the roll:
                  1. Total up the results from all dice.
                  2. All markers on your player board for the skill being
                     tested that are <= the roll total are counted as a
                     success.
                  3. Each ★ on effort dice also counts as 1 success.
                  4. Enter the total number of **successes** into the app (not
                     the roll total).
                  5. Follow any instructions in the app.
          * Results from a test may vary based on the number of successes.
          * A test never needs more than 6 successes.  The table below outlines
            what to expect for successes needed.

          | Test Difficulty | # of Successes to Pass |
          | --------------- | ---------------------- |
          | Easy | 1 |
          | Moderate | 2 |
          | Difficult | 3 |
          | Very Difficult | 4 |
          | Epic | 5-6 |

          ## Scanning Item Cards (white QR)
          * You can sometimes scan an item to complete an action at a point of
            interest. e.g. Heal someone by scanning herbs.

          ## Scanning Destiny Cards (gold QR)
          * You may have an option to scan your destiny card when talking to
            NPCs.
              * This often results in hints about how to accomplish your
                destiny.
          * You must choose which destiny path QR code on your destiny card
            to scan when selecting this option.
              * Reminder: the text shown in the is also **public**, but your
                actual destiny on your card is **not**.

          ## Scan or Test
          * Sometimes you will have an option to use an item *or* test a skill.

          ## Trading
          * When there is a trading option at a point of interest, the app
            will usually instruct you to create a "trade stack" by getting
            some specific item cards.
              * Place 1 trade stack token nears the cards.
              * Place the matching trade stack token next to the point of
                interest on the map.
          * The trade stack stays on the map for the rest of the game.
          * Items sold here can later be bought by other players.
          * During a trade action, a player may buy/sell any number of items.

          ## Maze (Witchwood)
          * There are multiple rewards to be found in each maze.
          * Correct paths through most mazes can be found somewhere during
            the scenario.

          ## Travel (Witchwood)
          * There are points of interest, with the "Path" prefix, that will
            allow you to travel to other locations.
          * The list of destinations can change during the scenario.

          ## Finale Interaction
          * Once you have fulfilled the requirements for your destiny,
            they can visit a specific point of interest (hinted on their
            destiny card) where there will be a special option to begin your
            finale.
          * Once you start the finale, you can no longer do normal turns.
              * Follow the instructions in the app for how to progress on your
                turns.
              * The number of turns needed to complete your finale depends
                on current and previous actions taken during the game.

      - name: Experience
        text: |
          * Experience may be spent to upgrade your skills.
          * For each experience spent, you may move your skill markers a
            *total* of 2 spaces, either 1 marker 2 spaces, or 2 markers 1
            space.
          * **There can never be 2 skill markers on the same space of a skill

      - name: Skill Gain/Loss
        text: |
          * Some actions may result in the gain (gold arrow) or loss (gray
            arrow) of skill points.
              * Move the skill marker to left in the indicated skill to
                gain a skill point.
              * Move the skill marker to right in the indicated skill to
                lose a skill point.
          * The app will usually indicate which skill to gain/lose, but if
            the token icon has no skill symbol, you choose which skill to
            gain/lose.
      - name: Items
        text: |
          * Each player is limited to a max of 5 item cards.
              * If you would ever have more than 5, you must either:
                  * Abandon the item by placing it near the board and using
                    a pair of trade stack tokens to mark the card(s) and the
                    location on the map.
                      * Any player may later, when visiting a point of
                        interest on this tile, pick up the item(s). Picking
                        up the item(s) is a **free action**.
                  * *OR* Use the discard ability on the card.
          * Items may be used at any time during your turn, and in any order,
            unless otherwise specified on the card.
