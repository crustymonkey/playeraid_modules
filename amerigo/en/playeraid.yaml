    - name: Setup
      text: |
        * Setup the map by randomly arranging tiles in a 3x3 manner (3P: 4x3, 4P: 4x4).
            * No water zones can be completely surrounded by land.
            * If land spaces on adjacent tiles connect, they must connect orthogonally, not diagonally.
            * If the volcano tile is in play, it must be one of the central tiles.
        * Place the time markers in ascending order on the time marker space on the frame.
        * If the volcano tile is in play, shuffle the gold tiles and put 1 face down on each space of the volcano.
        * Islands with more than 20 spaces are big islands. Place a treasure chest on each one.
        * Place commodity tokens on their printed spaces on each island.
        * Place all neutral landscape tiles facedown next to the board, along with the planning token.
        * Place all production buildings and their tokens next to the board.
        * Each player chooses a color and gets all pieces in that color.
        * Mix the pirate markers and randomly place 5 face down on the storage board. Reveal 1 at random.
        * Mix all progress tokens and place a random one face up on each space of the progress area.
        * Remove any unused production tokens based on player count. Mix them and place face up on the board.
        * Each player places a disc on the 0 space of the VP track.
        * Place a disc of each color randomly on the special action track. This determines player order.
        * First player gets no gold. Each other player gets 1 gold for every player that goes before them.
        * Drop all cubes into the tower and place any that fall out onto their spaces of the action circuit.
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        * Game is played over 5 rounds of 7 phases each. During each phase, each player takes 1 action in player order.
        * The first player takes all cubes from the current phase’s action circuit space and drops them in the tower.
        * Place all cubes that fall out on into the middle area of the action circuit.
            * The color of cubes determine which actions can be taken.
            * The largest number of cubes of a single color determine how many AP a player gets for any 1 action.
        * Beginning with the player whose disc is farthest along the special action track (discs on top goes first), each player chooses 1 available action and perform is. Multiple players can select the same action.
        * Player may instead decide to take gold. Gold = total # of cubes / 3, rounded up. Score 1 VP for each gold in excess of 12.
        * A player can use fewer AP than allowed.
        * After everyone has performed an action, move the cubes to their colored spaces and move onto the next phase.
        * May discard a treasure chest at any time to get 3 gold.
        * A player may spend any number of gold to increase AP by +1/gold on their turn.

            * First time chosen, place your ships on any spaces on the frames.
            * Each AP allows each of your ships to move orthogonally to an adjacent water space.
            * Each water space can only hold a single ship. Ships do not block other ships from passing through a space.
            * If a ship ends its movement on an anchor space, player can put a trading post on an adjacent trading post space if it is not occupied. First player to establish a trading post on an island gets 3 VP.

        * VP based on the highest number on or passed on the special action track.
        * Ties broken by which disc is on top of the special action stack.
