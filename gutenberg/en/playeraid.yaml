                Players secretly plan their actions during this phase.

                * Each player hides their initiative board and markers behind
                  their screen.
                * Everyone simultaneously allocates their markers among the
                  5 actions.
                    * Markers go in empty slots, **from left to right** on
                      an action's row.
                * When all players are ready, the plans are revealed.
                * Actions are resolved from top to bottom.  Note that the
                  sequence on the initiative board matches the main board.
                * For each action, the number of player markers in that row
                  determines the player order for the action.
                    * The player with the most markers is 1st.
                    * Ties are broken by player order.
                * A player **must have at least 1 marker on an action to take
                  that action**.

                  text: |
                      * Each acting player may choose 1 printing and 1
                        refinement card from the main board, creating an order.
                      * The order is placed in a free slot connected to their
                        printing house board.
                          * The 2 cards of an order can **never** be separated
                            or re-combined.
                          * A player may have a max of 4 orders.
                          * If a player has 4 orders and takes another, they
                            must 1st discard an existing order.
                      * Once all players have taken this action, discard any
                        remaining printing and refinement cards.
                      * If a player receives an order as a reward, they draw
                        2 printing and 2 refinement cards from their decks and
                        chooses 1 of each type to keep.  The unchosen cards are
                        discarded.
                          * If a player doesn't like the drawn cards, they may
                            pay 2 guilders to draw 2 additional cards of their
                            choice (2 printing, 2 refinement, 1 of each).  This
                            **can be repeated** as many times as the player can
                            afford.

                  text: |
                      * Each acting player may select 1 of the 3 inks from the
                        main board and may take 1-3 inks from that set.
                          * The 1st ink is free, the 2nd costs 1 guilder, and
                            the 3rd costs 2 guilders.
                          * Inks **must be taken from left to right**.
                          * A player may choose a set that was partially taken
                            by another player, but **the costs remain the
                            same**, which means 1 or 2 guilders for the 2nd
                            and 3rd inks.
                          * Inks are placed next to the player's printing house
                            board.

                - name: Develop Specialties
                  text: |
                      * Each player taking this action may choose 1 specialty
                        card from the main board.  Cards can be used in 1 of
                        2 ways:
                          * Move the indicated specialty marker(s) up 1 level
                            for each of that specialty's symbol on the card.
                          * Move any *other* specialty marker 1 level up.
                      * After players are done with this action, discard
                        all remaining specialty cards on the board.
                      * The 1st time a player reaches a level marked with
                        "**>**" on any of their specialty tracks, the player
                        advances their disc on the reward track to the next
                        space and takes the reward.
                      * Reaching the same reward level on another track does
                        **not** give any additional reward.
                      * If level VI is reached and the track would go up,
                        the player instead receives 3 guilders.
