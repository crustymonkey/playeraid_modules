    - name: Buildings
      sections:
        - name: House (x19)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the House is built must be connected to the road system.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** Houses are never bought. They come into play when other buildings are built.  
        - name: Townhouse (x19)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** When you must place a House on the board, you can, instead of placing an additional House, replace an existing House with a Townhouse, flipping the House tile to its Townhouse side. To replace an existing House with a Townhouse, all parcels surrounding the existing House must be occupied by other buildings, Houses, mountains, river or property tiles. This means that a Townhouse can not be placed on the edge of the board.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** A Townhouse is considered two Houses for calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes.  
        - name: Mine (x6)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** None  
            **Income:** $3 per adjacent mountain and $3 if adjacent to the river (regardless of the number of river spaces). Several Mines may benefit from the same mountain. Once you own a mountain, it no longer benefits other players' Mines.  
            **Special rule:** A Mine adds 1 point to your firepower (you receive an extra revolver token).  
        - name: Hotel (x6)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Hotel is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** $6

          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Church is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** A Church is considered a House when calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes. A Church allows the player to prevent other players' attacks. All your buildings directly adjacent to your Church cannot be attacked. If you build a Church near one of your buildings that's being attacked, the attack is canceled. The attacker returns his cowboy to his personal supply. The Church itself can never be attacked.  
        - name: Ranch (x6)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** None  
            **Income:** $1 for every neighboring free parcel, meaning a parcel of land that doesn't contain a House, building or mountain but one that can contain property tiles. Several Ranches may benefit from the same free parcel.  
            **Special rule:** A Ranch adds 1 point to your firepower (you receive an extra revolver token). A Ranch is considered a House when calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes.  
        - name: Drugstore (x4)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Drugstore is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** $3 per adjacent House and per Ranch owned by the player. The Ranch does not have to be adjacent to the Drugstore to boost its income. If the Ranch is adjacent to the Drugstore, it counts as both a Ranch and a House as usual.

          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Bank is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.

            **Income:** $5 per adjacent House.  
        - name: Blacksmith (x2)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Blacksmith is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** The income is $5 on the first round, $10 on the second round, $15 on the third round and $20 on the last round, plus $5 per Ranch owned by the player. The Ranch does not have to be adjacent to the Blacksmith to boost its income.  
        - name: Prison (x2)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the Prison is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** A Prison adds 2 points to your firepower (you receive two extra revolver tokens). A Prison cannot be attacked.  
        - name: Station (x1)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The Station may only be built along a road which crosses the whole map in a straight line.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** The Station does not provide income but allows to score victory points at the end of the game according to the development of the city. At the end of the game, the Station gives 1 VP to its owner for every two House symbols in the city, rounded down. The Station is considered two Houses when calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes. The Station can not be attacked to steal victory points.  
        - name: School (x2)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the School is built must be connected to the road system, and you must build three Houses. If playing with the river side of the board, only one School can be built on each side of the river.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** The School doesn't provide any income. A School is considered a House when calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes.  
        - name: General Store (x2)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the General Store is built must be connected to the road system, and the player must also build a House.  
            **Income:** $3 per adjacent House and $6 per adjacent House owned by the player himself. The General Store is the only building that receives income from Houses belonging to other players.  
        - name: City Hall (x1)
          text: |
            **Placement conditions:** The parcel on which the City Hall is built must be connected to the road system.  
            **Income:** $0  
            **Special rule:** The City Hall doesn't provide any income. A City Hall is considered a House when calculating Drugstore, Bank, Saloon, and General Store incomes.  
            As soon as the City Hall is drawn from the bag (during setup or the end of round phase), the first player (in turn order) immediately places it in the city on any unowned parcel (without paying). If no parcels are available which are connected to the road system, then the first player places new roads from the general supply (as few as possible) to create a valid parcel. Then continue to place new buildings on the action track as normal.  
            The City Hall may not be purchased by any player. To receive the benefit from the City Hall, you have to place a cowboy on it during the cowboy placement phase. Only one cowboy may occupy the City Hall. When a City Hall is contested, a duel occurs. This duel is resolved at the beginning of the building income phase.  
            The player occupying the City Hall increases all of his own building's income. Each building that they own increases its profits by one level, with the exception of Ranches and Mines. If a player loses ownership of the City Hall, his building's profits decrease by one level. In other words, the increase in income by one level is temporary and will end as soon as that player is no longer occupying City Hall. At the end of the round, the cowboy occupying the City Hall stays on the board.

                * Triple a Mine's income (once per mine per game round). You may spend the dynamite token at any time when performing the estate income action. If a cowboy from another player is present, he gets half this tripled value (rounded down). You may not perform this action in combination with the Grocer character card.
                * Place the dynamite token with a cowboy during the cowboy placement phase. In the case of a duel, you roll two dice (instead of one die) and add the results of the two dice to your firepower. (Important: with the Might is Right variant, you would also spend two duel tiles). If no duel occurs, the dynamite token is lost. **Important:** If a dynamite token is placed with a cowboy on a player's own Mine, the player gains both benefits of the dynamite (triple income from the Mine PLUS rolling two dice in a duel for that space if one occurs).

In all duels, the gunsmith is allowed to roll the die again (once) if desired (again, including those against an Outlaw). In addition, the gunsmith receives one dynamite token (see Prospector's rules). With the Might is Right variant, you select and play your duel tile after you opponents showed theirs. Cash limit: $20.

                You receive 2 no duel tokens for the current round. You can place these tokens with a cowboy when you choose any one of these actions: get 3 roads, get money (Nevada state Bank) or get victory points (town council of Carson City). A cowboy with a no duel token never takes part in a duel, and the action can be performed regardless of the presence of any other cowboy (even the Sheriff). If only one cowboy from another player is placed on the same space, no duel will occur and both players can do the action. If a duel occurs between two or more other players, the result of the duel doesn't affect the cowboy with the no duel token. Cash limit: $15.

                The singer can bring you luck. During the cowboy placement phase, the Singer may place a cowboy from the general reserve with a no duel tile on the gambling income space. During the third phase (perform actions), the player ignores any duels if other cowboys are present in this space and he rolls the dice for payout but multiples the dice together for a payout of $1 to $36. Cash limit: $40.

                The Auctioneer immediately chooses 2 parcels which belong to no player, and places the auction tokens there to indicate an auction for these two parcels. All players may join the auction (if they have enough money to pay for the bidding). Starting with the Auctioneer and then proceeding clockwise, each player may make a bid which must be higher than the previous bid. Once a player passes, he may not join the bidding again. Once there is only 1 remaining player in the auction, he pays half of his bid (rounded down) to the Central Bank and the other half to the Auctioneer (rounded up) and places two parcel tiles on the auctioned locations. If the Auctioneer wins the auction, he pays half the costs to the Central Bank (rounded down). If no player makes an offer, the lands remain unoccupied. Even if the Auctioneer pays only half the price he offered, he must have the full amount available. Cash Limit: $30.

                The Auctioneer immediately takes the 3 revolvers token and proceeds to auction off the ammo. All players can participate in the sale, including the Auctioneer (who can not bid more than the money he has). As before, players can continue to raise their bids during the auction until only one high bidder remains. The winner does not need to place a cowboy on the ammunition action space, but instead pays the winning amount directly to the Auctioneer and takes the 3 revolvers token. If the Auctioneer is the winner, he pays nothing. Cash limit: $30.

                The Governor immediately receives 1 road. In addition, the Governor receives 1 victory point each time he places a new road in the city, provided that this new road reaches at least one new parcel of land (without a road already). With the CARSON RIVER variant, a player gets two victory points if he builds a bridge (with two roads) provided that this new bridge also reaches at least one new parcel of land. Cash limit: $50.

                The player immediately chooses to tax either weapons or money. If he chooses to tax weapons, he gets $1 from the other players for each revolver token they have (only tokens, not revolvers from the mercenary). If he chooses to tax money, he gets $1 from the other players for each $10 they have, rounded up. The players cannot refuse to pay the tax. Cash limit: $50.

                When you choose the Doc-tor/Undertaker, you may choose either the yellow (Doctor) or red (Undertaker) side of the tile. The Doctor charges $3 to any player who wishes to reposition a defeated cowboy (outduelled by another player or an outlaw) onto an uncontested and unperformed location/action space, rather than into the players personal supply. If several players may reposition a defeated cowboy, they can consult the doctor (a Doctor's cowboy is always first, then in the order following the pass order track). The Doctor pays nothing for healing his own cowboys. Moreover, the Doctor receives $3 from the central bank for each defeated Outlaw. Cash limit: $60.

                For each defeated cowboy, a player must choose either to pay $2 to the Undertaker or to lose 1 Victory point. In addition, the Undertaker immediately gains $2 dollars from the Central Bank for each Outlaw defeated during the current round. The Undertaker does not have to be involved the duel to gain money. The Undertaker pays nothing for his own defeated cowboys. Cash limit: $90.

                When you choose the Cowboy, you immediately pay $8 and receive one Ranch amongst those available on the building track. Place one of your property markers on any unoccupied parcel of land and place the Ranch you just received on that property marker. The available buildings are all shifted down the line and a new building is taken out of the bag and placed on the $12 spot. If there are no Ranches available, take one out of the bag. If all six Ranches have already been bought, flip the Cowboy card to its yellow side. Cash limit: $20.

                During the entire round, all your buildings are protected from enemy attack, whether it’s from other players or the Outlaws. You cannot attack the buildings of other players. When moving the Outlaws, consider the income of all your buildings to be $0. If an outlaw is on one of your buildings during the income step, you still receive your normal income from that building. Cash limit: $240.
