                    you have for the battle (matching the foe's type).

                      * The app will tell you how many you have spent.
                  * For each battle card:
                      * You can spend these to make the card easier.
                      * You must resolve the losses or lose as much as
                        possible and gain 1 corruption.

                    removed from the board.

                  ### Other Foe Removing Effects
                  * Some other effects will let you remove foes from the board.
                      * Open the foe status screen to remove them.
                      * This is **not** a heroic action, so you do not gain
                        2 spirit.
                      * The Adversary cannot be removed this way.

                    retreat or continue.

                    goal, it will cause the Adversary to spawn on the board.

                  ### Explore a Dungeon

                      * Select an unexplored room to continue further into

                        results (press the "improve" button).
                      * Follow the instructions to resolve the room.
                          * If you cannot lose the what the room requires,
                            lose as much as possible and gain 1 corruption.
                      * After clearing a room (paying the costs and possibly
                        gaining a corruption), you may:
                          * Continue exploring the dungeon OR
                          * Leave the dungeon.
