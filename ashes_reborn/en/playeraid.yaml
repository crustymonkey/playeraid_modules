                       1 wound token on their phoenixborn until all players
                       have placed wounds equal to the cards they should
                       have drawn but could not.
          - name: Player Turns Phase
            text: |
                Players take turns taking 1 or 2 actions on their turn until
                both players consecutively pass on their turn.

                Each turn consists of 1 main action and 1 optional side action.
                These can be taken in either order.

                Once both players have passed for their main action
                consecutively, move to the [recovery phase](#recovery_phase)

                    ![main](/static/img/ashes_reborn/main_action.png) symbol

                    | ![magic](/static/img/ashes_reborn/magic_all.png) | **Magic**: Exhaust dice of the appropriate type and number.  Remember that higher level dice can be used to pay for lower level costs |
                    |  | **Parallel Costs**: If 2 costs are connected, you pay one **or** the other, not both |

                    ### Card Types
                    There are 5 different types of cards in a player's deck and
                    2 types that can be included in a player's conjuration pile.

                    * **Ally (Unit)**: Play an ally to an empty slot on your
                      battlefield.  **The number of slots in your battlefield
                      is determined by the battlefield value of your
                      phoenixborn**.
                        * Attack: How much damage your ally does.
                        * Life: How many wound tokens it takes to destroy the
                          unit.
                        * Recover: How many wounds are removed during the
                          recovery phase.
                    * **Conjuration (Unit)**: These start in a conjuration pile
                      and are brought into play by other card effects.  They
                      return to that conjuration pile when they leave play.
                      Attack, life, and recover work the same as an ally
                    * **Action Spell**: These are a 1-time effect that is then
                      played to your discard pile.
                    * **Alteration Spell**: These modify the units they are
                      *attached* to. When played, place it under a unit so that
                      its text is showing.
                    * **Conjured Alteration Spell**: These are considered to
                      be alteration spells, **not conjurations**.  These start
                      in a conjuration pile and are brought into play by card
                      effects. They return to the conjuration pile when they
                      leave play.
                    * **Ready Spells**: These remain in play to be activated
                      later. When played, they take an empty spot on your
                      spellboard. **The number of slots in your spellboard is
                      determined by the spellboard value on your
                      phoenixborn**.
                        * If you already have 1 or more copies of the same
                          ready spell, place the new on top of the existing
                          one(s).  **It does not take an extra slot**.
                        * Ready spells can be activated on a later turn.
                        * **Focusing a Ready Spell**: If you have more than
                          1 copy of ready spell, the spell is *focused*. Each
                          copy of the spell is separate and can have its
                          own exhaustion and status tokens.  It can be also
                          be activated separately. Some spells have focus
                          effects that can be used by all copies of that spell.
                    * **Reaction Spell**: These can be played on any player's
                      turn when its conditions are met. **Each player can only
                      play 1 reaction per turn**.
                        * **Other Reactions**: Some cards have reaction
                          abilities or effects on them (blue box). These may
                          be played from your hand as reactions when conditions
                          are met. **This counts toward your limit of 1
                          reaction per turn**.
