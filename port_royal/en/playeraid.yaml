        * If playing with less than 5 players, remove the special Expedition
          that is 5 players only (only card **without** a coin on the back).
        * Shuffle the remaining cards and set them face down.
        * Deal 3 "coins" to each player face down from the draw pile.  This is
          their personal display
        * **Note**: Each time a player gains coins, draw the appropriate
          number of cards from draw pile and place them face down with
          every coin visible in your display, but don't look at the front of
          the card.  Each card == 1 coin.
        * The player who last visited a harbor is the start player.

        Players take turns being the *active player* with each turn consisting
        of 2 phases, where sometimes the 2nd phase will be skipped.  If there's
        a 2nd phase, then **after the active player**, each other player
        may also act in that phase.  Then the active player changes.

        If the draw pile is ever empty, shuffle the discard to create a new
        draw pile.

            * The active player draws a card to place in the middle of the
              table, forming the "harbor display".
            * The player repeats the draw of cards until they either stop or
              2 identically colored ships are in the harbor display.
                * **Stopping**: Proceed to [phase 2](#phase_2).
                * **"Busting"**: Drawing 2 ships of the same color **that
                  cannot be repelled** will end the player's turn.
                    * Discard all of the harbor display (except Expeditions)
                      and move to the next player's turn.
                    * All players with a Jester in their personal display gain
                      1 coin.

            * There are 4 different types of cards that behave differently:
