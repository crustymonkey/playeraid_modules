        ## Core box

        * Choose a killer and a location from among the feature films. Remove
          the killer and location boards (box covers) and any associated
          components.
        * Choose a final girl to play as.
        * Take the player board from the core box and place it, choosing a
          difficulty (different sides). Place your final girl card below the
          player board.
        * Set the dice near your player board.
        * Take the action cards from the core box, setting the 6 zero cost
          cards aside (your starting hand).
        * Sort the rest of the action cards by their type and create a market
          tableau, with each card of a particular type in a stack.
        * Set the victim/special victim meeples aside along with their holding
          boards.
        * Remove the other meeples/tokens from the core box for use.

        ## Feature film

        * Place the chosen killer board above the player board.
        * Place the chosen location board to the right of the killer board.
        * Shuffle the killer's finale cards and place 1 face down, matching
          up the artwork.
        * Shuffle the killer's dark power cards and place 1 face down below
          the finale card.
        * Shuffle the killer's and the location's terror cards together, then
          take 10 random cards to form the terror deck.  Set the rest aside.
        * Shuffle the location's item cards and deal out 3 piles of 4 face
          down cards in their places above the location board and flip the
          top card of each pile
        * Shuffle the location's setup cards and draw 1.
            * Setup the board as depicted on the card using the core box
              components.
            * Place the card in its place above the location board.
            * The rest of setup cards can be returned to the box.
        * Mix the 9 black final health tokens face down (+1 die face up). Then,
          **without looking at them**:
            * Place 1 on the circle on the bottom left of the killer board.
            * Place 1 on the circle on the upper left side of the player
              board.
            * Return the rest to the box (also without looking at them).
        * Place health markers in the space on the left side of the killer
          and player boards until you have an amount matching the killer's
          and final girl's health, respectively.
            * **Important**: the *total* number of health tokens should include
              the black final health token.  e.g. If the final girl has
              5 health, they should have 1 black token and 4 heart tokens.
        * Place the bloodlust marker at the bottom of the bloodlust track
          on the right side of the killer board.
        * Place the time marker on the 6 space.
        * Place the 2nd killer marker on the horror track on the player
          board. The starting horror is indicated on the killer board.
        * Shuffle the event cards and place them face down next to the location
          board.
            * Draw the top card and follow the instructions on it.
        * You can now begin the game.

        - name: "1. The Action Phase"
          text: |
            The action phase mainly consists of playing cards for their
            effects.

            * The action phase will end one of the following happens:
                * You decide to stop.
                * You run out of cards to play.
                * An action card results in
                  ![redx](/static/img/final_girl/redx.png).
                * The time marker goes *below* zero.
            * Play action cards for their effects.
                * Most cards require a die roll.  The number of dice is
                  determined by the horror track and any other effects that
                  may be in play.
                    * If you and/or the killer is down to their last health
                      point (black or white token), roll an additional die
                      for each.  e.g. if both the killer and final girl
                      were on their last point of health, roll **2** additional
                      dice.
                * Some cards/effects will allow you reroll dice.
                * You will **always roll at least 1 die**.
            * Some cards allow you to move.
                * Adjacent spaces are usually indicated by a door or path.
                * When leaving a space, you may take **up to 2 victims** with
                  you.
                * Victims will **not follow you into the killer's space**.
                * If you move onto a "green door" space, you can rescue any
                  victims on the space.
                    * This could be victims already on the space or ones you
                      brought with you.
                    * This can be done even if you are passing through the
                      space.
                    * Place the victims on the final girl card and take the
                      shown rewards that are covered.
                        * If all spaces are filled on the final girl card,
                          flip it over to reveal the final girl's ultimate
                          ability.
                            * If there were additional victims saved, take the
                              reward on the new face-up side.
            * If you are on a search space, you can play a search card.
                * You may be able to draw 1 or more cards depending on die
                  results.
                * If it happens that cards on the tops of the search decks are
                  face down, do **not** reveal the top card (unless instructed
                  to do so).
            * Some cards allow you to recover health.
                * Recover 1 health per heart up to your max health.  You
                  **cannot** ever exceed your max health.
            * Attacking:  You must be in the same space as the killer unless
              you have an item or ability that allows otherwise (e.g. a ranged
              weapon).
                * If you have weapons/abilities that modify the damage, these
                  are applied **if you produced at least 1 damage**.
                * If the final (black) health token is removed from the killer,
                  check the other side of the token. Any excess damage is lost,
                  even if the killer comes back.
                    * If it shows hearts, replace the black token with a white
                      token and replenish the killer's health up to the
                      total number of hearts on the black token.
                    * If it shows no hearts, you win!
            * Some effects will cause you to lose time.
                * If you ever lose time below zero, the action phase ends
                  immediately.
                * You may discard cards to get 1 time each.
            * If the horror track would go below the first (green) space,
              increase time by 1.  If it would go above the final space (red),
              increase bloodlust by 1.
        - name: "2. The Planning Phase"
          text: |
            1. Spend time to purchase cards from the available tableau. The
               cost is shown in the lower right area of the card.
                * You **cannot** purchase cards that were played in the most
                  recent action phase.
                * You **cannot** purchase a card if it would drop the time
                  marker below zero.
                * You have a **hand limit of 10 cards**.
                * Note that some cards cost zero time.
            2. Reset the time marker to the 6 space.
            3. All action cards that were played that round are returned to
               the tableau, including the zero cost cards.  These can be
               purchased in later rounds.
        - name: "3. The Killer Phase"
          id: killer
          text: |
            1. Resolve the killer action show on their (top) finale card
               next to the "K" icon.
            2. (**If the finale has been revealed, skip this step**) Draw the
               top terror card and resolve its effects.

            ## Targeting
            The targets are determined via the following symbols:

            | Symbol | Target |
            | ------ | ------ |
            | ![victim](/static/img/final_girl/t_victim.png) | The target is the closes victim |
            | ![fg](/static/img/final_girl/t_fg.png) | The target is the final girl |
            | ![v_fg](/static/img/final_girl/t_fg_v.png) | The target is whoever is closest, either the final girl or a victim |

            1. If there is a tie for closest, choose the group with the most
               victims. Note that the final girl is **not** a victim.
            2. If there is still a tie, you decide (with optional ambiguity
               rules).

            ## Moving
            * The killer moves a number of spaces **per boot icon** based on
              their current bloodlust level.
            * The killer will always take the shortest path to its target.
            * The killer stops as soon as they have reached their closest
              target.
            * Note that sometimes the killer will move through a space with
              the final girl or a victim when they are not the intended target.

            ## Attacking
            * The killer will attack a single target for each knife icon.
                * If there is more than 1 knife icon, the killer will only
                  attack again in the same space, they will not move after a
                  kill.
            * If the killer ends up in a space with a with a non-target
              (couldn't reach their target), they will still attack.
            * The damage done is indicated by the current bloodlust level.
            * The killer will always attack victims before the final girl,
              unless the final girl is specifically the target.
            * Each victim has only one health.
                * When a victim is killed, add them to the dead victims area
                  and increase bloodlust by 1.
                * Any leftover damage the killer would do is lost.
            * If attacking the final girl, the attack automatically damages
              the final girl, losing health equal to the damage number shown
              on the bloodlust track.
                * If there is a 2nd knife icon, that is a separate attack
                  that must be resolved completely separately from the 1st
                  attack.
                * If this makes you lose your last health (black token),
                  reveal it and:
                    * If it is blank, you lose.
                    * If it shows hearts, replace the black token with a
                      white token and refill health to the number of hearts
                      shown on the black token.
                    * Any remaining damage from the attack is lost.
                * You may play blue reaction cards to prevent damage, or
                  apply damage back to the killer (retaliate).
                    * You may never use reaction cards to prevent health lost
                      via ![lose_h](/static/img/final_girl/sm_lose_h.png) icons.
                    * Reaction cards **cannot** be used to prevent damage
                      to victims.
                    * Each reaction card can be used for only 1 attack.
        - name: "4. The Panic Phase"
          text: |
            * Victims will panic if:
                * At least 1 victim was killed this turn (where and how doesn't
                  matter).
                * **AND** the victim is in the same space as the killer.
            * Roll a die for each victim and move them in the direction shown
              on the map.
                * If the rolled number is not shown on a path, the victim does
                  not move.
                * You may choose the order in which victims are panicked.

      text: |
        When there are no terror cards left in the terror deck, the finale is
        revealed (during the [Upkeep phase](#upkeep)).

        * Some finale cards have immediate effects.
        * **If the dark power is face down, reveal it as well**.
        * Note that there is a new killer action now in effect.
        * You will no longer draw a terror card during the [killer

        The game ends when you have killed the killer or the killer has killed
        you.  If both happen at the same time, you are still victorious!
    - name: Additional Rules
      sections:
        - name: Items
          text: |
            * You only have 2 hands, so you can either have 2 1-handed items
              equipped or 1 2-handed item.
            * Items that don't require hands can be used directly from your
              backpack.
            * Whenever you gain an item, you may equip it to your hands or
              put it in your backpack.
                * You can rearrange items freely whenever you gain an item.
            * Items can only be rearranged during the [Upkeep phase](#upkeep)
              or when you acquire a new item.
            * Your backpack can hold any number of items.
            * Some items have limited uses. Use tracking markers for the
              limited uses, unless they are single use.
            * If not otherwise specified, items have unlimited uses.

            ## Weapons

            * If you have a different weapon in each hand, you must choose
              **1** to use when resolving an attack.
            * The number in the upper left is the range of the item (e.g. zero
              indicates you must be in the same space).
            * The damage "splats" indicate how much *additional* damage they do.
                * The additional damage can only be applied if you did
                  at least 1 damage via an attack action.
        - name: Bloodlust and Dark Powers
          text: |
            ## Bloodlust

            * Whenever you would progress multiple spaces on the track, all the
              intermediate spaces are resolved.
            * This will increase the killer's movement and damage as well as
              unlocking the dark power.
            * If bloodlust reaches the max, it will trigger the final effect
              for each additional increase to bloodlust.

            ## Dark Powers

            * Some terror cards are minor dark powers.
                * These will give the killer new powers *and* extend the
                  killer's health.
                * When these come up, place the indicated number of health
                  markers on the card.
                * Whenever damage is done to the killer, it **must be removed
                  from the minor dark powers 1st!**
                * If all health markers are removed from a minor dark power,
                  discard it.
        - name: Events
          text: |
            * An event is reveled at the start of the game.
            * Events may be revealed during the game when indicated by the
              event icon.
                * It is possible to have multiple permanent events in play.
            * Some events are permanent, and some have 1 time effects and are
              discarded after applying the effects.
            * If the effects cannot be applied, the card is ignored. Do **not**
              draw another event in that case.
            * Some cards will bring special victims (different colors) into
              play.
                * Special victims are treated just like normal victims in terms
                  of following you, saving them, and panicking them.
        - name: Minions
          text: |
            * Minions can be present with or without the killer, depending on
              the scenario.
            * Minions each come with their own reference card with health and
              attack/movement values.
            * The number of minions that can be on the board is always limited
              by the number of minion tokens.
                * If you are told to place/spawn a minion and there are no
                  tokens available, the effect is ignored.

            ## Attacking a Minion

            * Generally, follow the same rules as when you attack the killer.
            * If the killer is in the same space as 1+ minions, you must
              1st decide whether you are attacking the killer or the minions.
              **You cannot attack both**.
            * If you choose to attack the minions and there is more than 1 in
              the space, you are attacking **all** of them.
                * You may divide damage among all the minions.
                * Any leftover damage is lost.
                * You **cannot** divide damage between minions and the killer.
            * Victims will follow you into a space that contains minions
              (unless the killer is also there).

            ## The Killer Phase

            * In addition to resolving the killer action on the finale card,
              there will also be a minion action.
                * Resolve the actions on the card from top to bottom.
            * When resolving terror cards, all *enemies* will perform any
              killer actions 1 at a time.
                * **Minions should always act 1st**, followed by the killer.

            ## The Panic Phase

            * If at least 1 victim was killed, victims in a space with a
              minion will panic (with the same rules as if they were with
              the killer).
        - name: Game Terms
          text: |
