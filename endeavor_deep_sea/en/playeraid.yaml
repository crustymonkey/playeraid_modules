          * Put out the starting ocean boards, as is shown on the scenario
            sheet.
              * Note that the scenario shows you how wide you can expand out.
              * **Any ocean boards with the "sun" symbol next to the name
                should not be used unless they are explicitly part of the
                scenario**.
      * Shuffle the remaining ocean tiles for each respective depth and create
        a stack for each.

      The game is played over the course of 6 rounds, with each round consisting
      of 2 phases.  Each phase is played in turn order starting with the
      player with the wave.
    sections:
      - name: "Phase 1: Preparation"
        text: |
          This phase is broken into 3 simple parts that each player completes
          before moving to the next player.

          ## Recruitment a Specialist
          * Chose 1 specialist that you can recruit based on your level
            on the reputation track.
              * The specialist must match your highest available tier or below.
              * You always get specialists on their junior side (blue).
              * Immediately take any instant bonuses (left side) shown on the
                specialist.
              * You may recruit duplicates of the same specialist.
              * Any "Inspiration" (green) or "Coordination" (yellow) track
                gains **are** usable in the next steps.
              * If you recruit a tier 5 specialist and it leaves an empty
                slot in the tray, move the top tile from another slot to
                this 1.

          ## Effort
          * Gain a number of discs from your supply into the staging area
            on your player board based on your level of the green track.

          ## Reassignment
          * Reclaim discs assigned on your specialists in the previous round
            according to the level of your yellow track.
              * You **cannot** remove discs placed on journals.
              * You **cannot** remove discs from ocean tiles.
              * You can retrieve the disc from your team leader in the 1st
                round.

      - name: "Phase 2: Activation"
        text: |
          Players take turns or pass during this phase.  Once you pass, you
          can no longer take turns during the round.  This continues until
          all players have passed.

          ## Taking Turns
          * This is *usually* done by placing a disc from your staging area
            onto 1 of your specialists to take the action(s) shown on it.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions separated by a "/".  You
                can only choose 1 of those actions.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions **not** separated by a
                "/".  You may perform all actions shown in any order.
                  * The actions may be performed in different zones.
                  * Multiple actions still count as a single turn.
                  * Each action must be fully resolved before activating the
                    other action.
                  * You can activate a specialist and not take its action.
              * Some actions will require you to place a 2nd disc from your
                staging area onto an ocean board to activate it.
          * If you have a journal with a special activation circle, you can
            place a disc from your staging area onto those to activate them.
              * This is done **instead of activating a specialist**.
          * You can always decline any reward or action you are entitled to.
          * To perform the action, you must have a sub in a zone with a
            matching action available.
              * Actions are always performed in the same zone as one of your
                subs, unless otherwise specified.
          * If you ever reach the impact symbol near the end of a track, gain
            1 impact.
              * If you ever advance beyond the end of a track, move your
                marker back to the impact spot and gain 1 impact (as shown).
          * If you reach a sub icon on the blue track, place a sub on the
            launch zone (for the scenario) and gain the arrival bonus.
              * This happens only the 1st time you reach each sub.
        sections:
          - name: "Action: Travel"
            text: |
              * Move your sub to a different zone and gain the arrival bonus
                of the zone where your movement ends.  This will allow you
                to take future actions in that zone.
                  * The max depth is determined by your location on the blue
                    track. e.g. if it shows 3 ingenuity symbols, you can dive
                    to depth 3.
                  * Your level on the blue track also determines the number of
                    zones you can move when taking this action.
                      * All movement is **orthogonal**. Subs cannot move
                        diagonally.
                      * You may not travel through empty spaces.
                  * The arrival bonus is shown below the travel symbol.
              * Note that new subs that are launched to the launch zone **do**
                get the arrival bonus of that zone.
          - name: "Action: Sonar (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Place a disc from your staging area onto the leftmost circle
                for a sonar action space and take any bonus shown there.
                  * If a zone has multiple sonar actions, you may place your
                    disc in the leftmost space of either.
                  * Some space will give you a link bonus.
                      * If you complete a link, you and the other player both
                        receive the bonus shown between the 2 discs.
                          * If both discs are yours, you only get the bonus
                            **once**.
              * If the space shows a "discover" symbol, peform a discover
                action:
                  1. Draw **2** ocean boards from the depths shown.  e.g. if
                     the symbol shows "3+", you could take 2 from depth 3, 4,
                     or 5, or 1 board from any 2 depths.
                      * You can draw from depths you cannot travel to.
                      * Note that the scenario sheet shows how wide your
                        ocean area can be.
                      * Aside from depth 1, there **must** be a zone of a
                        shallower depth to place it below.  e.g. you cannot
                        place a depth 4 tile in a column with no depth 3 tile.
                      * If your discovery is impossible to resolve, you must
                        draw from the shallowest possible depth.  e.g. if your
                        discovery is 1-2 and depth 1 and 2 are full.
                      * If the entire play area is full, gain impact instead
                        and skip the remaining steps.
                      * **If a drawn board has a sun symbol next to the name**
                        and it is not listed on your scenario, discard it and
                        draw a replacement.
                  2. Look at both boards and choose 1 to place.
                      * Place the board in a legal (above) space and place the
                        other board back at the bottom of its depth stack.
                      * If the zone has a dive site(s), place the specified
                        number of tokens face down on its space(s).
                  3. Claim the discovery bonus (1 time rewards in the top
                     left corner).
                      * Note that the bonus area will have a reminder to place
                        dive tokens on the board if it has a dive site(s).
          - name: "Action: Dive"
            text: |
              * Draw the top dive token from a zone you have a sub and reveal
                it.
