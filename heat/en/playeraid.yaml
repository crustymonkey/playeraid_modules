        * Place a board of your choosing on the table.
        * Each player takes:
            * a car in their color
            * a player mat in their color
            * a gear pawn in their color
            * 12 speed cards in their color
            * 3 starting upgrade cards
        * Check the board for how many heat and stress cards to add to each
          player's deck (usually 6 heat and 3 stress).
        * Shuffle your speed cards, including the upgrades and stress cards
          and place this facedown in the draw spot on your player mat (left
          hand slot).
        * Place the 6 heat cards faceup on the engine spot in the center
          slot on your player mat.
        * Put your gear pawn in 1st gear.
        * Place the remaining stress cards near the board.
        * Randomly place the cards on the starting grid to determine player
          order for the 1st round.
        * Each player draws 7 cards from their draw deck to form their starting
          hands.
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        The game is played through a number of rounds until a player has
        crossed the finish line after the final lap.  The number of laps
        is dependent on the track (printed on the board)

        * Note that the order of player turns is determined by the order of
          the cars on the track.  The 1st car will play 1st.
            * **If there are 2 cars next to each other, the car closest to the
              racing line is considered ahead for all purposes**.

        Each round consists of all players taking their turn, which will
        consist of:

        1. Adjust their gear
        2. Play cards
        3. Move their car
        4. (other intermediate steps are situational/optional)
        9. Draw back up to 7 cards

            * You may optionally change gears.
            * You can gear up 1 or down 1 for free.
            * You *may* gear up 2 or down 2, but you must pay 1 heat to
              do so.
        - name: '2. Play Cards (simultaneous)'
          text: |
            * The number of cards you **must** play is determined by your
              current gear.  e.g. If you are in 3rd gear, you **must**
              play 3 cards.
            * Cards are played **face down** into your play area.
            * If you have so much heat in your hand that you cannot play
              the required number of non-heat cards for your gear, cover
              the difference with heat cards **and then**:
                * Your does not move this turn.
                * Move your gear to 1st gear.
                * Place the cards in your play area in your discard pile.
                * Skip straight to step 9, [replenish](#replenish).
        - name: '3. Reveal & Move (in order)'
          id: reveal
          text: |
            Each player will take turns, in car order (1st car plays 1st),
            revealing and moving their cars and optionally/situationally
            taking actions 4-8.

            * Flip all the cards you played face up.
                * If you have flipped 1 or more Stress cards, follow this
                  procedure for each Stress to determine its speed.
                    * Flip the top card of your draw deck and if it is a
                      speed card (**must** have the speedometer symbol),
                      add it to your played cards.
                    * If the flipped card is not a speed card, put it in
                      your discard pile and keep flipping cards until you
                      draw a speed card.
            * Add the values of all the cards to determine your speed and
              move your car that many spaces forward on the track.
                * Cars never prevent you from passing them, even when it
                  looks like the track is blocked.
                * If you would end your movement in a space where all the
                  spots are taken, you are blocked and must put your car in
                  the 1st open spot behind the blocking cars.
            * After completing your movement, make sure your car is as close
              as possible to the racing line.
                * If there are 2 cars next to each other, the car closest to
                  the racing line is considered ahead for all purposes.

            **This only applies if you are the last player to move, or 1 of
            the last 2 cars in a game with 5+ cars**.

            * You may add 1 extra speed (move 1 extra space) before **or**
              after your boost (see [react](#react)).
            * You also get 1 cooldown (see [react](#react)).

            Activate any symbols you have access to in any order. You might
            have access to symbols from your current gear or
            [adrenaline](#adrenaline).

            ### Cooldown
            * For each cooldown (number in the symbol), take a heat card
              from your hand and put it back in your engine (center slot).
                * Note that you get 3 cooldown in 1st gear and 1 cooldown in
                  2nd gear.

            ### Boost
            * You may boost 1x per turn to increase your speed.
                * Pay 1 heat.
                * Flip cards from your draw deck until you get a speed card
                  (speedometer) and move your card the matching number of
                  spaces. Discard all other cards drawn before the speed
                  card, similar to Stress cards in the [reveal & move

        - name: '6. Slipstream'
          text: |
            **This only applies if you end your move next to, or behind,
            another car**. This is optional.

            * If you choose to slipstream, you move 2 spaces forward.
            * **Slipstreaming does NOT increase your speed value for the
              purposes of the [check corner](#chk_corner) step**.
        - name: '7. Check Corner'
          id: chk_corner
          text: |
            **This only applies if you crossed through a corner this round**.

            * Check if your total speed for the round is <= to the corner's
              speed limit.  If so, nothing happens.
            * If your speed is > the speed limit, you pay heat equal to the
              difference of your speed to the corner's limit.  e.g. if the
              speed limit is 3 and you went through the corner with a
              speed of 5, you would pay 2 heat.
            * If you go through more than 1 corner on the same turn, you must
              pay for each of them separately.
            * If you do not have enough heat to pay for your excess speed,
              you spin out (see below).

            ### Spin Out
            1. Move the car back to the 1st available space before the corner.
            2. Take stress into your hand based on your gear:
                * 1st or 2nd gear: 1 stress
                * 3rd or 4th gear: 2 stress
            3. Move your gear to 1st gear.
        - name: '8. Discard (optional)'
          text: |
            * You may discard cards from your hand if you do not want to
              use them in a future round.
            * **You can never discard heat or stress cards!**
        - name: '9. Replenish Hand (required)'

          text: |
            1. Put all cards in your play area into your discard pile.
            2. Draw back up to 7 cards.
                * At any point where you would need to draw cards and your
                  draw deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile into a
                  new deck.
                    * If this happens mid-turn, do **not** shuffle your play
                      area into your draw deck!
            3. The next player resolves steps 3-9.
    - name: End Game
      text: |
        When the 1st player crosses the finish line after the indicated (on
        the board) number of laps, this will trigger the end game phase.

        * If more than 1 car crosses the finish line, the car that is the
          furthest ahead wins.
            * Remember that the car closest to the race line is ahead.
        * Slipstreaming is **not allowed** if you have crossed the finish
          line of the last lap.
            * **You cannot slipstream across the finish line**.
        * Remove any cars that have finished and place them on the board in
          their positions and keep playing until every car has finished.

            With this module, each player will select custom upgrades **instead
            of** the 3 starting upgrade cards.

            * There are 2 sets of upgrades, basic and advanced. You can
              use any combination of upgrades you would like.
            * Additional setup: After placing your cars on the starting grid,
              draft the upgrade cards in 3 rounds.
                * Shuffle the deck before the 1st round.
                * Each round, deal out 1 card per player +3 cards.
                    * Rounds 1 and 3: Players choose 1 card based on their
                      position on the starting grid from last to 1st.
                      Discard any leftover cards.
                    * Rounds 2: Players choose 1 card based on their
                      position on the starting grid from 1st to last.
                      Discard any leftover cards.
            * After players have drafted 3 upgrades, they shuffle them into
              their deck instead of the 3 starting upgrade cards.
            * Some cards do have a "+" on them that is resolved like a stress
              card.
            * Some cards give you a choice of speeds, separated by a "/".
            * Note that most of the items on the upgrades are optional, but
              some are not.  Those will have the yellow "!" symbol showing
              that they are mandatory.

            ### Cards

            | ![adj_lim](/static/img/heat/adj_sp_lim.png) | If you cross a corner this turn, your speed is adjusted by #. "+" means you move faster, "-" means you must move slower. |

            Legends are automated drivers you compete against in either solo
            mode or as additional opponents.

            * Setup:
                * Shuffle the 10 legend cards and place them face down on
                  the legends mat.
                * Pick as many cars as you wish to add and add them to the
                  mix when filling the starting grid.
            * When it is time for the 1st legend to move, flip the top legends
              card face up -- this will be used for all legend car movements.
            * Resolve the movement value for the car's color.
            * If they are coming up to a corner:
                * If they have are between the corner and the legends line,
                  move them forward a number of spaces equal to the corner's
                  speed limit + the number in the diamond above their helmet.
                * If they have not crossed the legends line, they will
                  do one of the following:
                    * If they can move at their top speed **without**
                      clearing the corner, they will do so.
                    * If moving at top speed would cause them to clear the
                      corner, move them directly to space 0-3, corresponding
                      to the diamond value above their helmet.
            * Legends never splipstream, use heat, or cooldown.
            * Legends count when determining adrenaline, even though they
              do not get a benefit from it.
            * When the legends deck is empty, shuffle the deck into a new
              draw deck.
        - name: Weather and Road Conditions Module

            You can add weather and road conditions to any track.

            * Setup:
                * Shuffle the 6 weather tokens and draw 1 for the race.  Place
                  it on the billboard space.
                    * Adjust how many heat/stress cards you have for the race
                      depending on the token's effects.
                    * Weather tokens always modify the car setup for all
                      players **before** the race. They may also have an
                      effect in some sectors of the track if a weather road
                      condition token is in play.
                * Shuffle the 12 road condition tokens and draw 1 for each
                  corner of the race track.
                    * If the token shows an arrow, it modifies the
                      next sector (all spaces between this and the next
                      corner). Put it on the tent of that sector next to
                      the track.
                    * If it does not, it modifies the corner itself and is
                      placed on the tent at the corner.
