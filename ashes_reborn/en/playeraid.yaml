                       have drawn but could not.
          - name: Player Turns Phase
            text: |
                Players take turns taking 1 or 2 actions on their turn until
                both players consecutively pass on their turn.

                Each turn consists of 1 main action and 1 optional side action.
                These can be taken in either order.

                Once both players have passed for their main action
                consecutively, move to the [recovery phase](#recovery_phase)
            sections:
              - name: "Main Action: Pay a Main Action Cost"
                text: |

                    ![main](/static/img/ashes_reborn/main_action.png) symbol

                    |  | **Parallel Costs**: If 2 costs are connected, you pay one **or** the other, not both |

                    ### Card Types
                    There are 5 different types of cards in a player's deck and
                    2 types that can be included in a player's conjuration pile.

                    * **Ally (Unit)**: Play an ally to an empty slot on your
                      battlefield.  **The number of slots in your battlefield
                      is determined by the battlefield value of your
                      phoenixborn**.
                        * Attack: How much damage your ally does.
                        * Life: How many wound tokens it takes to destroy the
                          unit.
                        * Recover: How many wounds are removed during the
                          recovery phase.
                    * **Conjuration (Unit)**: These start in a conjuration pile
                      and are brought into play by other card effects.  They
                      return to that conjuration pile when they leave play.
                      Attack, life, and recover work the same as an ally
                    * **Action Spell**: These are a 1-time effect that is then
                      played to your discard pile.
                    * **Alteration Spell**: These modify the units they are
                      *attached* to. When played, place it under a unit so that
                      its text is showing.
                    * **Conjured Alteration Spell**: These are considered to
                      be alteration spells, **not conjurations**.  These start
                      in a conjuration pile and are brought into play by card
                      effects. They return to the conjuration pile when they
                      leave play.
                    * **Ready Spells**: These remain in play to be activated
                      later. When played, they take an empty spot on your
                      spellboard. **The number of slots in your spellboard is
                      determined by the spellboard value on your
                      phoenixborn**.
                        * If you already have 1 or more copies of the same
                          ready spell, place the new on top of the existing
                          one(s).  **It does not take an extra slot**.
                        * Ready spells can be activated on a later turn.
                        * **Focusing a Ready Spell**: If you have more than
                          1 copy of ready spell, the spell is *focused*. Each
                          copy of the spell is separate and can have its
                          own exhaustion and status tokens.  It can be also
                          be activated separately. Some spells have focus
                          effects that can be used by all copies of that spell.
                    * **Reaction Spell**: These can be played on any player's
                      turn when its conditions are met. **Each player can only
                      play 1 reaction per turn**.
                        * **Other Reactions**: Some cards have reaction
                          abilities or effects on them ([blue box]!blue!).
                          These may be played from your hand as reactions
                          when conditions are met. **This counts toward your
                          limit of 1 reaction per turn**.
              - name: "Main Action: Attack"
                text: |
                    When you attack, 1 or more of your **unexhausted** (no
                    exhaustion ![exhaust](/static/img/ashes_reborn/exhaust.png)
                    tokens) units will enter battle.

                    * **Battle**: An attacker deals damage equal to its attack
                      value and 1 exhaustion token is placed on it **and on
                      the defender if they counter**.
                    * **Counter**: Deal damage equal to the attack value of the
                      defender to the attacker. **Attack and counter damage
                      happen simultaneously**.

                    ### Attacking a Phoenixborn
                    1. **Declare attackers**: Choose any number of unexhausted
                       units to be attackers.
                    2. **Opponent declares blockers**: Your opponent may block
                       each attacker with up to 1 unexhausted unit.
                    3. **Resolve battles**: Resolve each battle 1 at a time.
                        * If blocked, the attacker battles the blocker and the
                          blocker counters.
                        * If unblocked, the attacker battles the opponent's
                          phoenixborn.

                    ### Attacking a Unit
                    1. **Declare attackers**: Choose **1** unexhausted unit
                       to be the attacker.
                    2. **Opponent declares guard**: Your opponent can guard
                       with their phoenixborn or an unexhausted unit.
                        * **A phoenixborn can only guard once per round, but
                          may guard even if exhausted**.
                    3. **Resolve battle**: 
                        * If guarded, the attacker battles the guard.  If the
                          guard is a unit, the guard counters.  If the guard
                          is a phoenixborn, tap it to show it can't be used
                          as a guard again this round.
                        * If unguarded, the attacker battles the target unit.
                          If it is unexhausted, your opponent may counter with
                          it.
              - name: "Main Action: Pass"
                text: |
                    When passing, you do nothing for your main action, but
                    **you may still take a side action**. If your opponent
                    does not pass on their next turn, you may take a main
                    action on your next turn.
              - name: Side Actions
                text: |
                    * **Pay a ![side](/static/img/ashes_reborn/side_action.png)
                      Cost**: Play or activate a card with a 
                      ![side](/static/img/ashes_reborn/side_action.png) play
                      or activation cost.
                    * **Activate a dice power**: Exhaust a die on it's power
                      side to activate it's power effect. See the dice power
                      reference card corresponding to that die.
                    * **Meditate**: This allows you to raise the levels of your
                      dice.  For each card you discard from the following
                      options, turn an active die to a side of your choice.
                        * Cards in your hand.
                        * Cards off the top of your deck.
                        * Ready spells from your spellboard.
          - name: Recovery Phase
            id: recovery_phase
            text: |
                During the recovery phase, each player simultaneously resolves
                the following steps **in order**:

                1. **Recover**: Remove a number of wounds from each unit equal
                   to its recover value.
                2. **Remove exhaustion**: Remove 1 exhaustion token from each
                   card you have in play. Rotate your phoenixborn so it is
                   upright.
                3. **Exhaust dice**: Move any number of dice from your active
                   pool to your exhausted pool.
          - name: End of Round
            text: |
                Note that some effects take place *after* the
                [recovery phase](#recovery_phase) as "at the end of the round"
                effects.

                * Resolve all of these effects one at a time starting with
                  the 1st player, who resolves all of their effects before
                  moving to the next player.
                * The effects can be resolved in any order.
                * After all effects are resolved, pass the 1st player token
                  to the next player.
    - name: Winning and Losing
      text: |
          If a player's phoenixborn has a number of wound tokens equal to or
          greater than its life value, that phoenixborn is destroyed and the
          other player wins.
    - name: Clarifications
      text: |
          * **Damage, wound tokens and destruction**: When damage is dealt,
            place a number of wound tokens on it equal to the amount of
            unprevented damage.
              * If a unit or phoenixborn has would tokens equal to its life,
                it is destroyed.
                  * A destroyed unit is discarded.
                  * A player's phoenixborn being destroyed means that player
                    loses.
              * A card's life is not reduced when placing wounds on it.
              * An effect that "deals damage" places wounds and destroys, but
                an effect hat "destroys" does not deal damage or place wound
                tokens.
          * **Discarding cards**: When a card in play is discarded or removed
            from play, set it aside **along with any cards underneath (attached)
            to it**. These cards will go to the player's discard pile.
              * **Discarded conjurations and conjured alteration spells return
                to the owner's conjuration pile**.
          * **Exhaustion tokens**: When a card has 1 or more of these tokens
            on it, it is exhausted.
              * Exhausted cards have no abilities or effects, but it retains
                its attack, life, and recover values (on units).  It also
                retains value bonuses (on alteration spells).
              * Exhausted units **cannot** attack, block, guard or counter.
              * Some cards have inexhaustable effects or abilities.  These
                are indicated by a [yellow text box]!#696a01!. These remain
                in effect even when exhausted.
          * **Status tokens**: These are generic counters that can mean
            different things as defined by their cards.
