            * The first player flips over the top stock exchange card and chooses where to place the frame based on the coordinates for the number of players. The frame must always be angled to use the largest possible area.* In a 2-player game, the first player places their neutral worker on an open space (no building). The second player then does the same. If there are no spaces without buildings, then the assistant is not placed this round.
