        * Setup the game board using the 12 board tiles with the 3 pieces
          with "holes" in their center in the center.
        * Place the 6 city tiles roughly equidistant around the game
          board.
            * **All water spaces must be connected after this step**.
        * Place the Zeus standee in the central space surrounded by 6 water
          spaces.  This is both the starting point and the end destination.
        * Take as many offering cubes of each color as players in the game
            * Distribute these offerings evenly among the 6 offering island
              spaces such that **no color occurs twice on any island**.
        * Place the 6 temples on the 6 temple islands.
        * Take as many monsters of each color as players in the game.
            * Place any 2 different monsters on the 3 marked monster islands
              and distribute the remaining evenly among the remaining 6
              monster islands such that **no color occurs twice on any
              island**.
        * Place the 3 statues of each color on the respective city tiles.
        * Shuffle the island tiles face down (cloud side up) and place them
          place them face down on the island spaces with colored borders.
        * Shuffle the oracle cards and place them face down as a draw pile
          near the board.
        * Shuffle the injury cards and place them face down as a draw pile
          near the board.
        * Lay out the companion cards as a face up stack.
        * Shuffle the equipment cards and display 6 of them. Place the
          remaining cards as a face down draw pile.
        * Create a pool of favor tokens.
        * Each player takes the following:
            * 1 ship in your color
            * 1 shield
            * 12 zeus tiles in your color
            * 1 player board
            * 6 god tokens (1 of each)
            * 3 shrines
            * 3 oracle dice
            * 1 action overview
        * Determine a start player and give them 3 favor tokens. In clockwise
          order each player receives 1 more player token than the previous.
            * e.g. in a 3 player game, the start player gets 3 tokens, the 2nd
              player gets 4, and the 3rd player gets 5.
        * Distribute the ship tiles in 1 of 2 ways:
            1. Randomly take a ship tile.
            2. Randomly pick ship tiles such that you have an amount equal
               to the number of players + 1. Beginning with the last player
               and going counter-clockwise, each player selects a ship tile.
               Return the unused tile to the box.
        * The last player of the round takes the Titan die and places it
          in the center of their oracle.
        * Each player:
            * Roll your 3 oracle dice and place them on their matching symbols.
            * Place the shrines on their spaces.
            * Draw 1 injury card and place it face up next to the lower left
              portion of your board.
            * Place your 6 gods on the lowest row of the god track.
                * Advance the god in the color of the injury card you drew
                  to the row showing number of players.
            * Place your shield on the 1st space of the shield track.
            * Place your ship on the starting space (where Zeus was placed
              earlier).
            * Sort your Zeus tiles.
                * 1 player should randomly choose 2 of the colored
                  offering/monster tiles and flip 2 of them to the monster
                  side (so that you have 2 offerings and 2 monsters).
                * All players should copy the player above so that each
                  player has identical starting zeus tiles.
                * **First game variant**: Play with only 8 Zeus tiles by
                  returning 1 of each:
                    * 1 shrine tile
                    * 1 statue tile
                    * 1 colored monster
                    * 1 colored offering
                    * **Note that everyone should still have the same
                      starting tiles left over**.
            * Place your action overview near your board.
