  - name: Gameplay

      The game is played over the course of 6 rounds, with each round consisting
      of 2 phases.  Each phase is played in turn order starting with the
      player with the wave.
    sections:
      - name: "Phase 1: Preparation"
        text: |
          This phase is broken into 3 simple parts that each player completes
          before moving to the next player.

          ## Recruit a Specialist
          * Chose 1 specialist that you can recruit based on your level
            on the reputation track.
              * The specialist must match your highest available tier or below.
              * You always get specialists on their junior side (blue).
              * Immediately take any instant bonuses (left side) shown on the
                specialist.
              * You may recruit duplicates of the same specialist.
              * Any "Inspiration" (green) or "Coordination" (yellow) track
                gains **are** usable in the next steps.
              * If you recruit a tier 5 specialist and it leaves an empty
                slot in the tray, move the top tile from another slot to
                this 1.

          ## Effort
          * Gain a number of discs from your supply into the staging area
            on your player board based on your level of the green track.

          ## Reassignment
          * Reclaim discs assigned on your specialists in the previous round
            according to the level of your yellow track.
              * You **cannot** remove discs placed on journals.
              * You **cannot** remove discs from ocean tiles.
              * You can retrieve the disc from your team leader in the 1st
                round.

      - name: "Phase 2: Activation"
        text: |
          Players take turns or pass during this phase.  Once you pass, you
          can no longer take turns during the round.  This continues until
          all players have passed.

          ## Taking Turns
          * This is *usually* done by placing a disc from your staging area
            onto 1 of your specialists to take the action(s) shown on it.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions separated by a "/".  You
                can only choose 1 of those actions.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions **not** separated by a
                "/".  You may perform all actions shown in any order.
                  * The actions may be performed in different zones.
                  * Multiple actions still count as a single turn.
                  * Each action must be fully resolved before activating the
                    other action.
                  * You can activate a specialist and not take its action.
              * Some actions will require you to place a 2nd disc from your
                staging area onto an ocean board to activate it.
          * If you have a journal with a special activation circle, you can
            place a disc from your staging area onto those to activate them.
              * This is done **instead of activating a specialist**.
          * You can always decline any reward or action you are entitled to.
          * To perform the action, you must have a sub in a zone with a
            matching action available.
              * Actions are always performed in the same zone as one of your
                subs, unless otherwise specified.
          * If you ever reach the impact symbol near the end of a track, gain
            1 impact.
              * If you ever advance beyond the end of a track, move your
                marker back to the impact spot and gain 1 impact (as shown).
          * If you reach a sub icon on the blue track, place a sub on the
            launch zone (for the scenario) and gain the arrival bonus.
              * This happens only the 1st time you reach each sub.
        sections:
          - name: "Action: Travel"
            text: |
              * Move your sub to a different zone and gain the arrival bonus
                of the zone where your movement ends.  This will allow you
                to take future actions in that zone.
                  * The max depth is determined by your location on the blue
                    track. e.g. if it shows 3 ingenuity symbols, you can dive
                    to depth 3.
                  * Your level on the blue track also determines the number of
                    zones you can move when taking this action.
                      * All movement is **orthogonal**. Subs cannot move
                        diagonally.
                      * You may not travel through empty spaces.
                  * The arrival bonus is shown below the travel symbol.
              * Note that new subs that are launched to the launch zone **do**
                get the arrival bonus of that zone.
          - name: "Action: Sonar (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Place a disc from your staging area onto the leftmost circle
                for a sonar action space and take any bonus shown there.
                  * If a zone has multiple sonar actions, you may place your
                    disc in the leftmost space of either.
                  * Some spaces will give you a link bonus.
                      * If you complete a link, you and the other player both
                        receive the bonus shown between the 2 discs.
                          * If both discs are yours, you only get the bonus
                            **once**.
              * If the space shows a "discover" symbol, perform a discover
                action:
                  1. Draw **2** ocean boards from the depths shown.  e.g. if
                     the symbol shows "3+", you could take 2 from depth 3, 4,
                     or 5, or 1 board from any 2 depths.
                      * You can draw from depths you cannot travel to.
                      * Note that the scenario sheet shows how wide your
                        ocean area can be.
                      * Aside from depth 1, there **must** be a zone of a
                        shallower depth to place it below.  e.g. you cannot
                        place a depth 4 tile in a column with no depth 3 tile.
                      * If your discovery is impossible to resolve, you must
                        draw from the shallowest possible depth.  e.g. if your
                        discovery is 1-2 and depth 1 and 2 are full.
                      * If the entire play area is full, gain impact instead
                        and skip the remaining steps.
                      * **If a drawn board has a sun symbol next to the name**
                        and it is not listed on your scenario, discard it and
                        draw a replacement.
                  2. Look at both boards and choose 1 to place.
                      * Place the board in a legal (above) space and place the
                        other board back at the bottom of its depth stack.
                      * If the zone has a dive site(s), place the specified
                        number of tokens face down on its space(s).
                  3. Claim the discovery bonus (1 time rewards in the top
                     left corner).
                      * Note that the bonus area will have a reminder to place
                        dive tokens on the board if it has a dive site(s).
          - name: "Action: Dive"
            text: |
              * Draw the top dive token from a zone you have a sub and reveal
                it.
              * When spending a token, you either take the action or get the
                amount of pictured research.
              * You may spend a dive token before, after, or between your
                actions.
              * You may spend a dive token **instead of activating a
                specialist** for your turn.
              * You may spend tokens on the same turn you acquire them.
              * You may spend a max of 1 token on your player board at the
                end of your turn.
                  * Any excess unspent tokens are lost.
              * You may spend any number of dive tokens on your turn.
              * If the supply runs out, shuffle the discard to form a new
                supply.
          - name: "Action: Conserve (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Pay the research cost for a space in a zone where you have
                a sub and place a disc from your staging area to get the
                displayed bonus(es). 
                  * Some spaces will give you a link bonus.
                      * If you complete a link, you and the other player both
                        receive the bonus shown between the 2 discs.
                          * If both discs are yours, you only get the bonus
                            **once**.
          - name: "Action: Journal (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Place a disc from your staging area onto a journal space in
                a zone where you have a sub. Spend the listed research cost
                on the matching journal cards and take it.
                  * The space's symbol **must match the symbol on the
                    journal card you take**.
              * The matching symbol has no bearing on what is activated on
                the card, all effects are activated regardless of the symbol.

              ## Journal Effects
              | Symbol | Benefit |
              | ------ | ------- |
              | ![points](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/points.png) | **Points**: Earn the displayed points at the end of the game. |
              | ![you](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/you.png) | **You**: You immediately gain all displayed benefits. |
              | ![others](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/others.png) | **Others**: These benefits are immediately gained by **all other players** (but not you). |
              | ![actions](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/actions.png) | **Actions**: For your turn, **instead of** placing a disc on a specialist, you can place a disc onto a journal action space. Discs on journal action spaces remain there for the rest of the game and may **not** be removed during reassignment. |
              | ![a_dive](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_dive.png) | Dive, and claim an additional dive token from that dive site (if any remain). |
              | ![a_travel](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_travel.png) | Travel, but treat your technology level as if it were 1 higher. That means you can move 1 extra zone and/or dive one depth deeper than usual. |
              | ![a_conserve](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_conserve.png) | Conserve at a conservation site where you have a sub at the same **depth**, even if you don't have a sub in the zone. |
          - name: Promotion
            text: |
              * When you receive a promotion effect, flip any junior specialist
                (blue side) to it's Senior side (gold).
              * You do not lose any attribute symbols that were on the
                junior side.
              * If there was a disc on the junior's circle when promoted,
                discard it back to your **supply**.
          - name: Special Zone Features
            text: |
              There are 3 basic types of special zone features.

              * **General Effects**: These will have a yellow warning triangle.
                These effects are not connected to any particular zone
                feature.
              * **Action Effects**: A yellow line leading away from a feature
                means that something special happens right after you
                activate that feature.
              * **Marked Spaces**: A yellow ring around a feature means that
                once you have a disc in that spot, the displayed special
                rule now applies to you.
          - name: The Impact Board
            text: |
              * Each scenario sheet has a different impact board layout.
                  * Some scenarios include special rules for how you
                    interact with the impact board.
              * When you gain impact, place a marker from your supply in an
                empty hex and gain any displayed reward.
                  * You may only place in a hex with an entry arrow pointing
                    to it, or in a hex that touches any other occupied hex.
              * Occupying hexes of certain colors will score you points at
                the end of the game (see the legend on the board).
              * A hex with a ∞ symbol can hold any number of tokens.
              * If you run out of markers, use a substitute.
          - name: End of the Round
            text: |
              * The round ends when all players have passed.
              * If it was the end of the 6th round, proceed to [final
                scoring](#scoring).
                  * You will know it's the 6th round because all players will
                    have 7 specialists, which includes their team leader.
              * Pass the wave token clockwise to set the new start player and
                begin the next round.
  - name: Final Scoring

        it and awards points.
          * Many goals offer leader bonuses as well.
              * If more than 1 player ties for 1st, they all earn 1st place
                bonus and no 2nd place bonus is awarded.

                multiple tied for the 2nd place bonus, all players tied for
                2nd receive the 2nd place bonus.
              * If you do not meet any of the goal's criteria, you cannot
                claim a leader bonus.
      * Add together your leftover research and discs in your staging area and
        divide by 3 (rounded down) and score this many points.

      The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the tied players
      share the victory.

      * At the start of each round (including the 1st), draw the top card of
        the stack.
          * Place bonus goals near the other goals on the scenario sheet.
          * Immediately apply the effect of any setbacks.

      ## How to Win
      * Play the game using the normal rules, but try to meet the thresholds
        for a set of goals.
          * Many co-op goals require you to reach a minimum amount of a
            particular criteria, determined by player count.  This does **not**
            mean that each player must individually meet that goal.  Instead,
            the team's **combined** amount must meet that goal.
      * At the end of the 6th round (7th if solo), assess your goals to see
        how many you achieved.
