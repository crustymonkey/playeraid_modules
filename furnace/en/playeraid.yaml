                  * You can also just choose 24 random cards to save time,
                    but it won't be as balanced.
              2. Mix those with the 24 company cards in the expansion.
              3. Return all unused company cards to the box.

                    and Capitalist cards.
                  * The player who will be going 5th in the 1st round receives
                    2 Start-up cards and 2 Capitalist cards, choosing 1 of
                    each.

                    card row.
                      * **1-3 players**: Use 2 Business School cards (return
                        the last to the box).
                      * **4-5 players**: Use all 3 Business School cards.

          an [auction phase](#auction) followed by a
          [production phase](#production).
      sections:
          - name: Auction Phase
            id: auction
            text: |
                This phase consists of the auction and the resolution
                of the auction.

                * At the beginning of the round, the 1st player cuts the deck.
                * Deal out a number of cards based on the player count:
                    * **2 players**: 6 cards
                        * **If playing with 2 players**, you will also need a
                          set of discs in a non-player color, and the die, to
                          act as a dummy player.  See the [2 player
                          mode](#twoplayer) section for more info.
                    * **3 players**: 7 cards
                    * **4 players**: 8 cards
                * **If playing with Interbellum**:
                    * The Business School cards will be at the end of the
                      company card row.
                    * Place 1 manager token on each Business School card.

                ### Bidding
                Players take turns in clockwise order beginning with the
                1st player.

                The player **must** place a disc on one of available company
                cards following these rules (note that some capitalists
                break these rules):

                * There **cannot** be 2 discs belonging to the same player on
                  1 card.
                * There **cannot** be 2 discs with the same value on 1 card.

                The bidding continues until all discs have been placed.

                ### Interbellum

                * The players also have a variable value player disc.
                    * The default value is zero.
                    * The value of the disc can be increased (before placing)
                      by spending 1 coal to increase its value by 1.
                        * To indicate a bid of 10+, place the number of coal
                          cubes on the disc for each number above 9. e.g.
                          2 cubes should be placed on it to indicate a value
                          of 11.
                    * The variable disc is placed according to normal rules.
                        * It cannot be placed on a card with a disc of the
                          same value.
                        * It cannot be placed on a card with another of the
                          same player's discs.
                        * Text effects that mention a disc with a specific
                          value do **not** affect the variable disc, even
                          if the value matches.
                    * When retrieving your variable disc, reset the value
                      to zero.
                * Business School cards will be the last cards to be resolved.
                    * The owner of the disc with the highest value takes the
                      manager token on it (**not the card**).
                    * There are 2 compensation options on the Business School
                      cards.  When getting compensation, the comp. can be
                      divided between the 2 options.  e.g. if you have 3 disc
                      on it, you could do 1 comp. action for all 3 or split
                      it up so you do 2 of 1 and 1 of the other.
                    * If there are no discs on a Business School card, the
                      manager token is discarded.
                * **Manager tokens are not resolved during the auction phase**.
                  They are resolved during the [Production phase](#production).

                ### Resolving the Auction
                Resolve the cards in the middle of the table from **left to
                right**.

                * Resolve the cards 1 at a time until completely resolved
                  before moving to the next card.
                * If there is no disc on the card, remove it from the game.
                    * **If playing with Interbellum** and the card is a
                      Business School card, the manager token is discarded
                      instead.
                * If there is at least one disc on the card:
                    * The player with the highest bid gets the card.
                        * **If playing with Interbellum** and the card is a
                          Business School card, take the manager token instead
                          of the card.
                    * All **losing** players take the "compensation" shown
                      at the top of the card.
                        * **Compensation**: The compensation that is received
                          is the number on the disc times whatever is shown
                          at the top.
                            * Resources: Take the number of resources multiplied
                              by the disc value.
                            * Processing: Take the processing action a number
                              of times up to the disc value.
                            * **If playing with Interbellum** and the card is
                              a business school card, you may mix and match
                              between the compensation options (see above).
                    * **Note**: The person who takes the card does **NOT** get
                      compensated.  They only get the card.
                * When all cards are resolved, players take their discs back.
          - name: Production Phase
            id: production
            text: |
                Players run their engine in this phase to gain or process
                resources.  This can be done simultaneously.

                * **If playing with Interbellum**:
                    * At the beginning of the production phase (before the
                      card resolution below), players can place their manager
                      tokens on their company or start-up cards (1 per card).
                    * Placed manager tokens add an **additional** effect to
                      the card when resolving it.
                    * The manager effect can be resolved at any time when
                      resolving the card.
                    * Manager effects are optional.
                    * Manager tokens are removed from cards at the end of the
                      round, but the tokens stay with the player (to be placed
                      again next round).

                The cards in each player's display are resolved with the
                following rules:

                * The cards can be activated in any order.
                * Each card can only be activated **once** per production
                  phase.
                * When activating a card, you only activate the colored
                  symbols. "Transparent" symbols are **not** activated.
                * **All** effects must be activated (that the player
                  can/wishes to activate) on 1 card before moving on to
                  another card.
                * Start-up cards allow you to upgrade another card in your
                  display if the player can pay the cost.
                    * If a card has already been resolved, and is later
                      upgraded in the same round, the player **cannot go
                      back and get the additional effect**.
                    * If a card is upgraded before being resolved, both
                      effects can be used when resolving the card.
          - name: End of Round
            text: |
                * Move the round marker to the next number.
                    * If the 4th round was completed, players add up their
                      money to determine final scores.
                * Pass the 1st player token to the left.
    - name: 2 Player Mode
      id: twoplayer
      text: |
          * Take a set of discs in a non-player color and the die to act as
            a "dummy" player for the game.
          * **If playing with Interbellum**:
              * Choose 1 agent card.
              * Set aside their discs, including the variable disc.
                  * The value of the variable disc is always equal to the
                    value in the top right of the agent card.
              * Allocate space on the table for the "dummy" player's cards.
              * After rolling the die and selecting a card (below), refer
                to the agent's card to find which disc should be placed.
              * When resolving the auction, give the agent the company cards
                and manager tokens where they had the highest bid and money
                for each compensation transaction they are entitled to (as
                indicated on the agent card).
              * In the production phase, give the agent money according to
                their card.
              * If the agent has more money than they other players, the agent
                wins.
          * During the auction phase, **after the 2nd player's bid**, roll the
            die and place the lowest numbered "dummy" player disc on the
            card corresponding to the number (furthest left = 1, furthest
            right = 6). **Follow regular placement rules**. If the lowest
            number can't be placed on the indicated card, do the following:
              1. Proceed up in disc numbers until a disc can be placed.
              2. If no discs can be placed on the card, move to the next card
                 (to the right) and repeat step 1.
                  * If the 6th card (furthest right) cannot have a disc placed
                    on it, go to the 1st card (furthest left)
          * At the end of the auction phase, remove any cards from the game
            that would have gone to the dummy player. Note that players still
            receive compensation for those cards as normal.
    - name: Variant Rules
      text: |
          * All of the player's cards (including their Start-up cards) must
            form a horizontal chain.
          * After each auction phase, players must assign places for the
            newly received cards in their chain.
              * The relative order of the cards in the chain **must stay
                the same**.
          * In the production phase, the cards in the chain are executed **in
            order** from left to right.
    - name: Interbellum Individual Module Changes
      text: |
        If playing with Interbellum, you may choose individual modules to use
        instead of adding everything. There are some restrictions when doing
        so.

        * When playing without the new Company cards, put the 2 manager tokens
          allowing you to resolve the delivery once more back in the box.
        * When playing without the manager tokens:
            * Do not use the Capitalist with the Personal Manager.
            * *But you are playing with the variable capital discs*, place
              an additional company card for each auction.
        * When playing without variable capital discs, do not use the
          Capitalist with the +2 to the variable disc.
