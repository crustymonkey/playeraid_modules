          * Player setup: each player takes the following in their player
            color.
              * 1 player board
              * 6 action wedges
                  * 1 player randomly arranges their action wedges (starting
                    side up) on their player board, and then all other players
                    match that arrangement on their own player boards.
              * 3 knight tokens
                  * Place 2 of them in their slots on your player board.
                  * The 3rd knight will be placed on the main board later.
              * 16 building tokens
                  * Place them on their corresponding spots on your player
                    board.
              * 12 action tokens
                  * Place 2 action tokens on each wedge of your action wheel.
                  * Note that your knight (below) may alter this.
              * 5 troop tokens
                  * Place these in the slots at the top of your board in
                    ascending order (left to right).
              * 2 random knight order tiles
                  * Choose 1 place it in its slot at the top of your board.
                  * Return the unchosen knight order to the box.
                  * **Note**: The chosen knight may affect your player setup.
          * General setup
              * Place the game board on the table on the correct side for the
                player count (3-4 or 2 players).
              * Place 1 Prussian and 1 Slav token on the top spaces of their
                matching strength tracks.
                  * Shuffle the remaining tokens together and then randomly
                    place them on all the spaces with flag icons.
                  * Saracen tokens should be placed so that the building or
                    troop icon on the token is face up.
                  * Note that not all the enemy tokens will be used. Return
                    any leftovers to the box.
              * Shuffle the building bonus tiles face down and then randomly
                place them face up on the empty spaces on the board matching
                their shape.
              * Randomly choose a start player.
              * In **reverse turn order**, each player places their 3rd knight
                onto 1 of the starting regions (knight icon) on the board.
                  * **Only 1 player can be in each starting region**.
              * Stack the enemy award tiles into 3 piles so that the 1st place
                award for each enemy is on top of the stack.

                    used at the end of the game.
                  * **2 players**: 140 influence
                  * **3 players**: 200 influence

    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
          The game takes place over a series of rounds and ends when the last
          influence token is taken, finishing the round such that everyone has
          had an equal number of turns.

          On your turn, you have a choice of 1 of 2 actions:

          * [Resolve an Action](#resolve_action) **OR**
          * [Upgrade a Wedge](#upgrade_wedge) **OR**
          * [Skip Your Turn](#skip_turn)

          After your turn, play proceeds to the left.
      sections:
        - name: Resolve an Action
          id: resolve_action
          text: |
              1. Choose an action(s) on a wedge to resolve.  The number of
                 tokens on the wedge determines the strength of the action.
                  * **Note that other things on your player board can boost the
                    strength of your actions**.
              2. If you have upgraded the action wedge and it now displays 2
                 actions, you split your tokens (strength) between the 2
                 different actions.
                  * You may assign all tokens to 1 action.
                  * **You must assign at least 1 token to an action to resolve
                    it**.
                  * The 2 actions may be resolved in any order, but 1 must be
                    fully complete before resolving the 2nd action.
              3. After resolving the action(s), collect all the tokens from
                 that wedge and distribute them, 1 at a time, clockwise around
                 your wheel starting with the wedge directly after the 1 you
                 are resolving.
          sections:
            - name: Travel Action
              text: |
                  This allows you to move your knights on the main board.

                  1. Distribute your action points (from tokens and player
                     bonuses) between your knights.
                  2. Move your knights according to the following rules:
                      * Leaving a region costs 1 movement point.
                      * Leaving a region **with an enemy token**
                        (Saracen/Prussian/Slav) costs 2 movement points.
            - name: Muster Action
              text: |
                  This allows you to flip the troop tokens on the top right
                  of your board. This will make your
                  [crusade actions](#crusade) more powerful and gain you
                  influence.

                  1. Check the cost of the lowest level face down troop token.
                     This is how many action tokens (plus bonuses) are
                     necessary to muster this troop.
                  2. Collect influence tokens equal to the troop's level.
                  3. Flip the troop token to its mustered side.
            - name: Crusade
              text: |
                  1. Choose 1 region containing 1 of your knights and an enemy
                     token and determine the enemy's strength (see the
                     enemy's strength track).
                  2. You must spend action tokens + crusade bonuses >= the
                     enemy's strength.
                  3. When you defeat the Prussians or Slavs, collect influence
                     tokens equal to their strength and advance the marker on
                     the enemy's track 1 space. Take the token from the board
                     and keep it for end game scoring.
                  4. If you defeat a Saracen (always strength 6), note the
                     building pictured on the token. You may then build a
                     building of that type in the defeated Saracen's region or
                     flip your next troop tile (as appropriate).
                     If you do, collect influence based on the level of the
                     building or troop (otherwise, collect 3 influence). Keep
                     the enemy token in your play area for end game scoring.
            - name: Influence
              text: |
                  Collect influence equal to the strength of the action + any
                  influence bonuses.
            - name: Build
              text: |
                  **Important**:

                  * You cannot build in a region with an enemy token.
                  * Each region can only contain 1 building.

                  ---

                  1. Choose a building and then pay action tokens + build
                     bonuses to pay for the build action for that building.
                     Note that some regions and building bonus tiles on the
                     board show a build discount.
                  2. Place the building on the square in a region occupied by
                     1 of your knights.
                  3. Collect influence equal to the level of the building
                     you built. Note that some bonuses grant additional
                     influence.

                  Note that uncovered action bonuses on your board **are
                  cumulative**.

                  Unlocked knights are placed onto the same region as the
                  castle that unlocked them.
        - name: Upgrade a Wedge
          id: upgrade_wedge
          text: |
              1. Set aside any tokens that are on the wedge you want to
                 upgrade.
              2. Flip the wedge to its upgraded side.
              3. Return the tokens you set aside to the wedge.
              4. (optional) You may choose to distribute the action tokens of
                 any wedge like you normally would. Note that it does **not**
                 have to be from the wedge you upgraded (do not take the
                 action though).
        - name: Skip Your Turn
          id: skip_turn
          text: |
              If all of your wedges are upgraded and you don't have any useful
              actions, you can just distribute the tokens from a wedge.
    - name: End of Game and Scoring
      text: |
          When the last influence token is taken from the supply, finish
          the round (equal turns) and the game ends. **Players may still
          collect influence tokens after the supply is empty**. Use the tokens
          set aside at the beginning of the game.

          ## Scoring
          * For each enemy, award 5 influence to the player that has the most
            of that enemy's token. Award 2 influence to the player with
            the 2nd most. **You must have at least 1 enemy token to qualify
            for this**.
              * If there is a tie, split the points between tied players
                according to the back side of that enemy's majority tile.
              * If there is a tie for 1st place, 2nd place is **not**
                awarded.
          * Count the end game influence for level 4 buildings.
              * **Castle**: 4 influence for each set of different enemy tokens
              * **Church**: 6 influence
              * **Farm**: 1 influence for each of your knights on the game
                board and each mustered troop at the top of your board.
              * **Bank**: 4 influence for each of your level 4 buildings
                on the game board **including this one**.

          Whoever has the most influence wins.

              During setup, instead of randomizing the order of the wedges,
              ensure that all players setup their wedges according to the
              diagram below. Players also do **not** sue the "Upgrade a
              Wedge" action.

              During setup, each player randomizes the order of their own
              action wheel.

              Do note that this can result in slight imbalances between the
              players. This can be played with or without knight order tiles.
        - name: Knight's Tournament
          text: |
              Prior to setup, each player selects the knight order of their
              choice, as well as the order of the action wedges. For this
              variant, multiple players can use the same knight order tile.
