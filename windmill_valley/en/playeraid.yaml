      * Place the main board.
      * Place the "X" tiles, wheel enhancements, farm enhancements, tulip
        bulbs, and tool tokens near the board.
      * Shuffle each type of wheel enhancement tiles separately, forming
        stacks face down. Place them near the main board.
          * Draw 2 common, 1 uncommon, and 1 unique enhancements and place
            them on their spaces on the main board.
      * Shuffle the farm enhancements into a face down deck and place it
        near the main board.
          * Draw 3 farm enhancements and place them in any order face up
            on their spaces on the main board.
      * Place the floodgate marker and the water level marker on their lowest
        numbered positions on their tracks.
      * Shuffle the foreign trade cards and place them in a face up stack on
        the main board.
      * Choose a 1st player.
      * Give each player:
          * 1 farm board
          * 1 windmill board
          * 1 player aid
          * 1 tool token
          * 9 windmill tokens (in their color)
          * 5 player markers (in their color)
      * Each player places their player markers:
          * On the "5" space of the VP track
          * The starting position of the calendar track
          * On the guilder track on their farm boards:
              * 1st player: 4th position
              * 2nd player: 5th position
              * 3rd player: 6th position
              * 4th player: 7th position
      * Randomly choose a number of starting farm enhancements equal to the
        number of players + 1 and place them face up.
          * In **reverse** turn order, each player chooses 1 card and places
            it under the top leftmost slot of their farm board (showing the
            top half of the card).
          * Place the remaining card on the main board next to the calendar,
            flipping it to the queen's wish side.
      * In **reverse** turn order, each player places 1 of their player
        markers on an area of the market without another player marker.
        Then:
          * 2 players: Place 1 neutral marker in each of the 3 areas of the
            market.
          * 3 players: Place 1 neutral marker in each of the 2 areas of the
            market.
          * 4 players: Place 1 neutral marker in the next area
            counter-clockwise from the 1st player's marker.
          * Return any remaining neutral markers to the box.
      * Players should set aside their 5th player marker for now.
      * Players then receive:
          * 1st player: 1 white tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 2nd player: 1 yellow tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 3rd player: 1 red tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 4th player: 1 violet tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
      * Each player should place their windmills into groups, in the slots
        on the left side of their farm board (top to bottom: 1/1/2/2/3).
      * If playing with less than 4 players cover the respective part of the
        calendar with the limit tile, leaving the last column of the calendar
        uncovered.

      Players will continuously take turns until someone reaches the end of
      the calendar track, which triggers the [game end](#game_end). You will
      then finish the current round (equal turns) and then play 1 more turn.
