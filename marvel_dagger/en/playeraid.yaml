      2 phases.  The players win by completing the 3 nemesis missions and
      then defeating the nemesis in the final showdown.
    sections:
      - name: Hero Phase
        text: |
          * Each hero takes a turn, starting with the 1st player and going
            clockwise.
          * Each turn consists of a hero spending an aspect token **1 action**.
              * The token is placed on an aspect slot on a card or component.
              * Each slot can only hold 1 token.
              * Actions with the "**BOOST**" keyword can give you additional
                benefits if you spend a boosted aspect token.
          * After the heroes have spent all of their aspect tokens, proceed
            to the [Nemesis phase](#nemesis).

          ### Aspect Actions ###
          * **Move**: The hero moves their standee to an adjacent space
            (connected by dotted lines) a number of times up to their move
            value.
          * **Fight**: This allows the hero to attack an enemy in their space.
              * Roll the number of dice matching the attack value (ATK).
              * For each success, the enemy suffers 1 damage.
          * **Defy**: This allows the hero to place progress on a mission (that
            requires a Defy action).
              * Roll the number of dice matching the defy value (DFI).
              * Apply successes as described by the mission.
          * **Rest**: This action allows a hero to recover damage and charge
            support cards.
              * Roll the number of dice matching the tactic value.
              * Add the number of successes to their automatic successes
                on their rest action.
                  * The total successes can be split between recover and
                    charge effects.

          ### Hero Abilities ###
          * Some hero abilities require an action token, and some do not. The
            latter are considered to be always active.
          * Some abilities have a **PRIMED** or **EMPOWERED** icon and those
            cannot be resolved without a primed or empowered token.

          ### D.A.G.G.E.R. Actions ###
          * If a hero is on a base, they can place an aspect token on the
            base's aspect slot to perform this action.
          * Resolve that base's D.A.G.G.E.R. effect.
          * The hero may place their hero mission into their hero mission
            slot (if not there already).
          * If there is an overrun token on the base, D.A.G.G.E.R. actions
            can be performed if called for by a mission, but you **cannot**
            resolve the D.A.G.G.E.R. effect or place hero missions into play.
          * **Note**: Asgard is *not* a base and cannot be overrun.

            text: |
              * Threat advances by:
                  * The threat value on the nemesis sheet.
                  * 1 for each non-nemesis enemy in play.
                  * 1 for each overrun base.
                  * The threat value of any side or hero missions (that have
                    a threat value).
          - name: "2. Check Nemesis Mission"
            text: |
              * Check the top card of the nemesis mission deck to see if it
                is completed. It can be completed by either passing or failing.
                  1. Check the progress, and if there are progress tokens
                     >= to progress value, the mission is passed.
                      * Note that some missions have a value that is based on
                        player count.
                      * If the completed mission was the 1st strike, remove it
                        from game and reveal the 1st nemesis mission.
                      * For any other mission, if passed, flipe the completed
                        mission and slide it under the top fo the game
                        board so that only the green checkmark effect is
                        visible.  Then, resolve the effect.
                  2. Check the mission's threat value and if >= to the value
                     on the threat track, the mission has failed.
                      * If the failed mission was the 1st strike, remove it
                        from the game and reveal the 1st nemesis mission.
                      * For any other mission, flip it and slide it under the
                        board so that the red "X" is showing and resolve that
                        effect.
                  3. If any mission was completed (passed or failed), reset
                     the threat track to zero.
                      * If the mission was a nemesis mission, also spawn a
                        new side mission.
              * **If the final nemesis mission was completed**: Proceed to
                the [Final Showdown](#final_show).
          - name: "3. Resolve Event Cards"
            text: |
              If there are no event cards in the event deck, **the players

              * Resolve the text of the event.
              * ![miss_eff](/static/img/marvel_dagger/miss_eff.png) Resolve
                the ongoing mission effects at the bottom of all active

                new side mission in an empty side mission slot.
                  * If there is not an empty slot, instead advance threat by
                    1 + number of heroes.
              * ![nem_ability](/static/img/marvel_dagger/nem_ability.png)

                    Nemesis.
                  * If there are multiple enemies of the same rank, the players
                    choose the activation order.
                  * When activating enemies, they resolve the **1st** item
                    (not all) in this list that they can:
                      1. Attack a hero in its space
                          * If there are multiple heroes, players choose which
                            hero is attacked.

                          * The enemy moves 1 space toward the nearest
                            operational base in its region. If there is a tie,
                            the 1st player chooses the base it moves towards.
                          * If there is no operational base in the region,
                            the enemy moves towards the nearest operational
                            base.
              * The nemesis follows the same rules as other enemies (above).
                  * If the nemesis is stunned, just remove the stun token
                    and damage, but don't resolve an attack/overrun/move.
              * Spawn enemies as shown on the bottom of the event card.
                  * This is done in the same manner as during [setup](#setup).
                  * If all enemies of the rank shown are already on the board,
                    advance threat by that enemy's rank instead.
                      * For nemesis specific enemies, advance it by the nemesis

          * When a hero is defeated:
              1. Advance the threat track by the number of heroes in the game.
              2. Return the hero's standee, mission card, and hero-specific
                 support cards to the box.
                  * Shared support cards remain.
              3. Remove all tokens from the character sheet.
              4. Flip the hero's aspect sheet to its shattered side.
              5. Flip the hero sheet to its other side.
              6. Ready the new hero's team-up card **for free** (ignoring
                 the team-up track).
              7. At the start of the next hero phase, place the new hero
                 standee on any base.
          * If a shattered hero is defeated, the player is out of the game.
              * Per player effects still count the eliminated player.
              * The remaining heroes have until the end of the next hero
                phase to begin the final showdown, otherwise **they lose
                the game**.
