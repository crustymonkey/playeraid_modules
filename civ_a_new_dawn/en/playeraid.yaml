            text: >
                Each player takes a leader sheet, chooses a color, and takes
                all of their colored components.  Each player sets their tech

            text: >
                Each player places their focus bar and places the five "I"
                focus cards under the focus bar in the order specified on the
                bottom of their leader card.  Each player places a caravan

                <p>After your first game, players will construct their own
                map.  The players will initially construct the <b>CORE</b>,

                <li>Take 2 random tiles that have a natural wonder and 2
                random tiles that have a city-state and shuffle all 4 together.
                These are your <b>CORE</b> tiles.</li>
                <li>All <b>CORE</b> tiles will be placed on the same side
                (either all side A, or all side B).</li>
                <li>Form the core by drawing and placing the core tiles, 1 at
                a time into the center of the table.  Place the tiles in the
                order below.  Place a trade token on each of the <b>CORE</b>
                tiles to show that they are <b>CORE</b> tiles.<br/>

                player.  Return any remaining to the game box.</li>
                <li>Starting with a random player and moving clockwise, each
                player chooses and places of their 3 tiles.  Each tile can
                be placed on <b>either of its sides</b>, but the following
                restrictions must be obeyed:
                <ul><li>The tile being placed <b>must touch at least 4 spaces on
                tiles that are already on the table</b>.</li>
                <li>The tile <b>must touch the core</b>, even if it must be
                flipped to do so.  If it can't touch the core while satisfying
                the previous restriction, it must touch a tile that is touching
                the core.</li>
                <li>If a player places a capital-city tile, he or she must place
                his or her capital city on that tileâ€™s capital city icon.</li>
                <li>If a completely enclosed hole in the map is formed, the
                players fill the hole with water tokens.</li></ul></li>

            text: >
                The player chooses one of the 5 cards in their focus row and

            text: The player resolves the text on the card.

                Pick up the chosen card, then move all cards in lower slots one
                space to the right.  Then, place the chosen card in the first
                slot.
    - name: Spaces and Terrain
      text: >
          <p>Each hex on a map tile is a <b>space</b>.  Spaces each have a
          <b>terrain</b> represented by different art.  There are 5 types of
          terrain, each of which corresponds to a slot in the focus bar.</p>
          <p><table><tr><th>Type</th><th>Slot</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Grassland</td><td>1</td></tr>

          <p>Water has a difficulty of one, but players can't move onto water
          unless a card specifically allows it</p>
          <p>If a space appears to have more than 1 terrain, its terrain is the
          type that covers the most area on the space.</p>
    - name: Friendly and Rival
      text: >
          <p>All of the control tokens and plastic figures of a player's color
          are <b>friendly</b> to that player.  All of the control tokens and
          plastic figures of other colors are considered <b>rival</b> to that
          player.</p>
          <p>Caravans <b>do not</b> cause a space to be friendly or rival</p>
    - name: Empty Spaces
      text: >
          Spaces are empty if they don't contain any tokens or plastic figures
          of any kind.
    - name: Resources and Natural Wonders
      text: >
          <p>Resources (marble, mercury, oil, and diamond) can be collected
          and spent to build world wonders.</p>
          <p>A natural wonder token can be used <b>once per turn</b> for the
          resource depicted on the tile.  It is <b>not</b> returned to the
          supply when used.</p>
          <p>Spaces with a natural wonder <b>do not have a terrain type</b>.
          However, <b>all natural wonder spaces have a difficulty of 5</b></p>
    - name: Mature Cities
      text: >
          A city is mature when each space adjacent to it either contains
          a friendly control token or is a water space.  Cities on the edge of
          the map are easier to mature as there are less spaces to place
          control tokens in.
    - name: Focus Cards
      text: >
          <p>There are 5 types of focus cards.  Each is designated by its icon
          in the upper left corner of the card.</p>
          <p>Each focus card can be upgraded with more powerful versions.
          If a focus card is upgraded, you always replace the same type of card
          in your focus row.  i.e. A level 2, 3, or 4 <i>Science</i> card
          can replace a lower level <i>Science</i> card in the focus row.</p>

                <p>These cards allow you to place control tokens on the map. 
                The focus row slot determines the type of terrain that
                control tokens can be placed on.</p>
                <p>Unused control tokens can be placed on spaces <b>adjacent to
                a friendly city</b>.  If the space contains a resource or
                natural wonder, the player takes that token.</p>
                <p>The player must obey these rules:
                <ul><li>The player can't place the token on a water space or
                on any space where the terrain corresponds to a higher focus
                row slot. <b>All natural wonders are treated as a difficulty
                of 5</b>.</li>
                <li>The space can't contain a barbarian token.</li>
                <li>The token must be place on its unreinforced side.</li></ul>

                <p>The science focus card advances your tech dial.  The focus
                row slot determines how much the dial advances.</p>
                <p>If you advance to, or pass, a tech level on the dial, the
                player gains a new focus card of that tech level and replaces
                an existing focus card <b>of the same type</b> (Science must
                replace Science, for example).</p>

                <p>Economy cards allow you to use your caravans and interact
                with city-states and rival cities. The focus row slot
                determines the terrain types that the caravan can move
                onto.</p>
                <p>A caravan on a player's economy card can only move onto 
                the map out of a players <b>capital city or a mature city</b>
                as though it was already in that city's space.</p>
                <p>The player must obey the following rules:
                <ul><li>The player cannot place or move a caravan onto water
                or any space whose terrain corresponds to a higher focus row
                slot.</li>

                <li>The player can't move more than 1 caravan to the same
                city or city-state during the same turn</li></ul></p>
                <p>When moving onto a city or city-state, resolve the following
                in order:
                <ol><li>The player returns the caravan to their economy
                card.</li>
                <li>The player gains 2 trade tokens from the supply.
                <ol type="a"><li><b>City-State:</b> The trade tokens are placed

                <li><b>Rival City:</b> The trade tokens are placed on focus

                <li>The player may take one diplomacy card.
                <ol type="a"><li><b>City-State:</b> If a copy of the
                city-state's diplomacy card is available, the player takes a

                <li><b>Rival City:</b> The player chooses one of that rival
                player's available diplomacy cards.  If the player already
                has one of that rival player's diplomacy cards, they must
                return it before taking another card from the
                player</li></ol></li></ol></p>
                <p>Other caravan rules:
                <ul><li>Caravans can move through city-states and rival cities,
                but they cannot stop and remain in those spaces</li>
                <li>When a caravan moves to the space of a conquered city-state,
                it resolves the effect of a rival city</li>
                <li>After a caravan returns to the economy card, it can't move
