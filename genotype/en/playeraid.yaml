          1. Place the board.
          2. Place the 5 offspring dice and the 2 parent gene tiles next to
             the board and their matching punnet squares.
          3. Create a supply of coins and trait markers.
          4. Place 4 starting coins on the board in the matching spots
             next to the 4 punnet squares.
          5. Place the round tracker on the 1 space (upper right).
          6. Place the 4 abacus price markers on their starting spaces
             (darker beads).
          7. Place the new plot tiles, dice slots, and assistant cards
             next to the research upgrades area.
              1. Draw 3 assistant card and place them face up next to the
                 deck.
          8. Shuffle the pea plant and tool cards, then place them face down
             next to the nursery and tool shed (respectively).
               1. Flip cards face up to fill the nursery and tool shed from
                  their decks.  (See the table below for the number of cards
                  based on player count)
          9. Give each player a player mat as well as 3 action markers and
             3 phenotype research markers in their color.
              1. The 2 additional action markers for each player are placed
                 with the research upgrades.
              2. Each player takes 1 coin, then draws 3 pea plant and 1 tool
                 cards from their decks.  Players then place 1 pea plant
                 in a garden plot on their player mat, keep 1 of the 
                 remaining 2, and discard the last.
          1. Give the 1st player marker to the player who has most recently
             done any garden work.

                      This action is taken on your player mat. Follow these
                      steps for this action:

                      1. Draw 1 pea plant or tool card, either face up or face
                         down.
                      2. Harvest any pea plant cards that have all their traits
                         covered with trait markers. Return trait markers to the
                         supply and place the pea plant face down next to your
                         player mat for end game scoring.
                      3. You may place pea plant cards from your hand in any
                         open slots on your player mat.

                      * During
                        the [plant breeding phase](#breeding_phase), you will
                        be able to take an additional die and place it in this

                        up on either side **or** remove a gene tile.
                        **You cannot flip a tile already on the board*.

                        allow you take 1st pick of a die during the plant
                        breeding phase.
                      * If there is a coin next to the corresponding punnet

                      ## 2nd Shift
                      * Taking this action has no immediate effect, but it will
                        allow you take 1 earlier pick of a die during the plant
                        breeding phase.

                1. Roll all 20 dice and sort result according to the current
                   punnet square layout for dice **I-IV**.
                    * A die showing an **X** is rerolled **exactly once**.
                        * If it shows a number, put it in the appropriate place.
                        * If it again shows an **X**, place it in the *De Novo*
                          mutations area for its color (see below).
                2. Players take turns picking dice to validate (cover) traits
                   on their pea plants. Each die taken is used to cover a trait
                   on the player's board and then is place in an unused die
                   slot.  **In order to take a die, the player *must* have an
                   available die slot and *must* use the die**.
                     1. Players with 1st shift spots take a die of the matching
                        color
                     2.  In right to left order, players with action markers
                        on the 2nd shift select **any** 1 die.
                     3. Finally, players continue taking dice in turn order
                        beginning with the 1st player until everyone passes.

                ## *De Novo* Mutations
                * The dice in these slots can be taken instead of normal dice.
                  When taking taking these dice, they are used in **1** of 2
                  ways:
                    * Gain 1 coin and place the **X** die in a die slot.
                    * "Mutate" another die: Take the **X** die and another
                      die of the same color and place them in 2 dice slots.
                      You may validate (cover) **any trait of the die color**.

                * Players can purchase 1 or more permanent upgrades.
                * Turns are taken in **reverse turn order**.  Start with the
                  player to the right of the 1st player.
                * There are 4 types of research upgrades:
                    * **New Plot**: Take a new plot tile and place it next
                      to your player mat.
                    * **Dice Slot**: Take a dice slot and place it next to your
                      play mat.
                    * **Action Marker**: Take an additional action marker in
                      your player color.
                    * **Hire Assistant**: Take 1 of the available face up
                      [Assistant cards](#assistants) and place it next to
                      your player mat.  **Assistant cards are not refilled
                      until the end of the round**.
                * Player must pat the cost in coins of the current price of
                  that upgrade. **Each time a player purchases an upgrade,
                  the price is increased by 1**.
                * Players continue taking turns (again, in **reverse turn
                  order**) buying 1 upgrade at a time until all players have
                  passed.
                * Players may choose not to buy any upgrades.

                * Move each abacus marker 1 space to the left.
                * Discard the remaining pea plant, tool, and assistant cards.
                  Refill tool and pea plant cards based on player count in
                  the [setup](#setup). If decks have run out, shuffle the
                  discards to make a new deck.
                * Refill 1 coin next to each punnet square.
                * Return all action markers to players.
                * Return all dice to their pools next to the board.
                * **Do NOT** remove or modify the parent gene tiles or any
                  of the players' phenotype research markers, pea plants,
                  trait markers, or research upgrades.
                * Start the next round by going back to the
                  [working phase](#working).
    - name: End of Game
      text: |
          The game ends after the plant breeding phase of round 5.  **Each
          player may harvest any completed pea plant cards**.

          * **Completed pea plant cards**: Score the points printed on completed
            pea plants.
          * **Phenotype research goals**: Score the indicated points for each
            instance of the matching trait(s) among completed pea plants.
          * **Incomplete research**: Players score 1 point per trait marker
            on their incomplete pea plants.
          * **Unspent coins**: Players score 1 point for each unspent coin.

          The player with the most points wins.  If tied, the player with
          the most completed pea plants wins.  If there's still a tie,
          the tied players share the victory.
