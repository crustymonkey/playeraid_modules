  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played in a series of turns until all players have either
      escaped the dungeon or have been knocked out.

      * On your turn, you must play all of your cards, but they can be played
        in any order.
          * Cards are played to a "play area" in front of you.
      * You may take a variety of actions during your turn and each action
        may be taken as many times as you like (and can afford).
          * Actions may be taken after playing all cards, or during card plays.

      ## Cards Generate the Following

      | Icon | Description |
      | ---- | ----------- |
      | ![skill](/static/img/clank_catacombs/skill.png) | Used as currency to acquire cards / use device actions. |
      | ![sword](/static/img/clank_catacombs/sword.png) | Used for the fight a monster action and may be used as part of movement actions through monsters. |
      | ![boot](/static/img/clank_catacombs/boot.png) | Used for the movement action. |
      | ![gold](/static/img/clank_catacombs/gold.png) | Used for the movement action. |
      | **Clank** | Whenever you make clank, add that many cubes to the clank area.  If your supply is empty, skip this. Negative clank allows you to remove cubes from the clank area. |
      | **Card Draws** | These cards are drawn from your personal deck. If your deck is every empty, shuffle your discard (but not the cards in your play area) to make a new deck. |

      * Some cards have effects that are dependent on other cards, tokens, etc.
      * Once you have played all your cards, you can [end your turn](#end_turn).
    sections:
      - name: 'Action: Acquire a Card'
        text: |
          * Spend skill (blue diamonds) to acquire cards.  The cost is shown
            in the lower right corner of the card.
          * When buying from the dungeon row, **do not immediately replace
            the card**.  These will be replaced at the [end of your
            turn](#end_turn).
          * Acquired cards are put into your discard pile.
      - name: 'Action: Use a Device'
        text: |
          * You may also purchase devices (purple banner) from the dungeon
            row.
          * These are immediate effects that you activate when purchased.
          * After using the card, it is placed into the dungeon discard, **not
            into your discard**.  Like other cards, do not immediately replace
            these as they will be replaced at the [end of your turn](#end_turn).
      - name: 'Action: Fight a Monster'
        text: |
          * The swords required to defeat a monster are shown in the lower
            right of the card.
          * Gain the reward shown on the card when the monster is defeated,
            then put the card in the discard pile. Like other cards,
            do not immediately replace these as they will be replaced
            at the [end of your turn](#end_turn).
          * You may fight the goblin any number of times (spending 2 swords
            each time), but **do not discard it**.
      - name: 'Action: Movement'
        text: |
          * Boots are used for movement between rooms. All tunnels require at
            least 1 boot to move through.
          * When you move to the edge of a tile without an adjacent tile,
            discover a new tile (see below).
          * A tunnel with footprint icons requires 2 boots to travel through.
          * A tunnel with a monster icon deals 1 damage to you per monster
            icon when you move through it. You may spend a sword (per
            monster) icon to avoid this damage.
              * You are not required to use your swords when moving through
                monster icons.
          * You may spend a lockpick to move through tunnels with a lock icon.
              * Place the lockpick token over the lock icon to show that it
                is **permanently unlocked**.
              * If more than 1 lock icon exists on a tunnel, a lockpick per
                lock icon must be spent to move through the tunnel.
          * You can only move in the direction shown by the arrow for 1-way
            tunnels.

          ## Discovering a New Tile
          * New tiles are only added to empty spaces (never stacked).
          * A tile must share an *entire* edge with an adjacent tile.
          * Placing a new tile will complete the tunnel you are moving through,
            which may add icons that you have to deal with to continue
            movement.
              * If you cannot afford to continue moving through the tunnel
                (not enough boots/lockpicks/etc.), you must rotate the tile
                so that you **can** move onto the new tile.
          * The 1st 4 tiles you discover are purple, then the blue tiles after
            that are considered to be the depths.  See [game end](#end_game)
            for more information on the depths.
          * See [tile features](#tiles) for information about the symbols on
            the tiles.

        id: action_buy
        text: |
          * When you are in a market room, you can buy tokens from the market.
          * All items cost 7 gold.
          * You may buy more than 1 item in a turn.
          * You may buy more than 1 of the same item.
          * See [tokens](#tokens) for descriptions.
      - name: 'Action: Take an Artifact'
        text: |
          * This is a free action that you can take at any point during your
            turn.
          * You cannot take an artifact if you already have one (unless you
            have a [backpack](#tokens)).
          * When you take an artifact, move the dragon marker up 1 space on
            the rage track.
      - name: 'Action: Pick a Chest, Library, or Prison'
        id: pick
        text: |
          * Spend a lockpick to open one of the following items.
          * Cover the feature on the tile (with the lockpick) to show it has
            been used **and cannot be picked again**.

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![chest](/static/img/clank_catacombs/chest.png) | Immediately take a major secret from the bank and reveal it. You cannot pick a chest if there are no more major secrets to claim. See [tokens](#tokens) for descriptions. |

These are kept for scoring at the end of the game. You cannot pick a prison if there are no prisoners remaining. See [tokens](#tokens) for descriptions. |
      - name: End of Turn
        id: end_turn
        text: |
          Do the following to end your turn.

          1. Put all cards from your play area into your discard.
          2. Draw 5 new cards from your deck.
          3. Refill the dungeon row to 6 cards.
              * If there dungeon deck does not have enough cards to refill it,
                the game ends immediately and all remaining players are knocked
                out.
          4. If any of the new cards has a dragon attack symbol, the dragon
             attacks (only once, no matter how many cards with the symbol
             were revealed).
              1. Put all cubes in the clank area into the dragon bag.
              2. Shake the bag and draw a number of cubes equal to the current
                 number shown next to the dragon marker on the rage track.
                  * Cubes are placed on players' health tracks, starting with
                    the leftmost space.
                  * If a white cube is drawn, **every** player takes 1 damage
                    (place a cube on their health track from their supply).
          5. Any white cubes drawn **are returned to the bag**.
          6. If the bag is empty after an attack, the game ends immediately and
             all remaining players are knocked out.

          ## Health Meter
          * If you take damage from a dragon attack, use the cubes that came
            from the dragon bag.
          * If you heal, return a cube from your health meter to your supply.
          * If you move between rooms with a monster symbol(s), you lose 1
            health for each monster that you do not kill with a sword.
          * If your health meter is completely filled, you are knocked out.
            See [end game rules](#end_game) for more info.
  - name: End of Game
    id: end_game
    text: |
      The game ends when all players have either escaped or have been knocked
      out.

      * You escape when you return to the crypt (where you started). Finish
        your turn and gain 1 of the 20 point mastery tokens when you do this.
      * You are knocked out when your health meter is filled.
          * Lay your pawn on its side to show that it is knocked out.
          * If you don't have an artifact or you are knocked out in the
            depths, **you will score 0 points**.
      * When a player has escaped or been knocked out:
          * They stop taking regular turns and take no game actions.
          * They no longer add clank to the clank area.
          * Cards that affect all players do **not** affect them.
          * They take no damage from cubes drawn from the dragon bag.
          * They neither draw or play cards.
          * Each time it is their turn, they instead perform a dragon attack,
            but they ignore the current rage track and draw 4 cubes (6 in a
            2 player game).
      * When all players have escaped or been knocked out, proceed to scoring
        (below).

      ## Scoring
      Score the following:

      * The value of any artifact(s) acquired.
      * 1 point per gold.
      * Points from other tokens (monkey idols, mastery tokens, etc.)
      * Points on cards in your deck/hand/discard (green symbol in the upper
        right of the card).

      The player with the most points wins.  If there is a tie, the tied
      player with the most valuable artifact wins.

      | ![artifact_plus](/static/img/clank_catacombs/t_artifact_plus.png) | Instead of placing the top artifact, place the 2nd or 3rd artifact in the stack (1 or 2 "+" symbols). If the artifact stack is empty, do not place an artifact. |

  - name: Card Effects
    text: |
      * **Acquire**: Gain these benefits once when purchasing the card.
      * **Arrive**:  Carry this out immediately when the card is added to
        the dungeon row.
          * This happens before any dragon attack.
          * If any cards with an arrive effect are in the dungeon row at
            the start of the game, these should be applied before the
            1st player takes their turn.
      * **Danger**: When pulling cubes from the dragon bag for a dragon
        attack, pull 1 additional cube for each of these cards in the
        dungeon row.
      * **Discard**: You can only discard cards in your hand that you
        haven't played yet.
          * Discarded cards do **not** have their effects activated.
             e.g. a stumble discarded this way will not produce clank.
      * **Each Player**: Each player does a thing.  The order shouldn't
        matter, but if it does, begin with the player taking their turn
        and proceed clockwise.
          * Ignore players that have escaped or have been knocked out.
      * **Teleport**: This takes you directly from 1 room to another.
          * No boots are required.

          * You can teleport against an arrow.
