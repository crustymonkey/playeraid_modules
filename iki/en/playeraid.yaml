              Decide how far your Oyakata will move on the main board.

              * In the order determined by the firefighting track (reminder:
                if there's a stack of discs, the order is top to bottom),
                players place their Ikizama on an open space on the Ikizama
                track.
                  * The number (or range) determines how far your Oyakata will
                    move, **exactly**.
              * Once everyone has placed their Izikama, move on to
                [Phase B](#ph_b)

              Starting with the rightmost space (1-4 movement) of the Izikama
              track, players take turns taking income/hiring and then
              moving their Oyakata and doing business.

              1. Income/hiring: each player has the choice of either taking
                 income **or** hiring a character.
                  * **The player on the 1-4 space does not receive income or
                    hire people**, but instead takes 1 mon.
                  * If you take income, take 4 mons.
                  * If you take hiring, choose an available character and pay
                    the cost in the top-left part of the card.
                      * **If you do not have a free Kobun, you must take income
                        instead**.
                      * Place the character in an open space on the main board
                        and place 1 of your Kobuns at the bottom of its
                        experience track.
                      * **Remember to the pay the extra cost of the space**
                        (1 or 2 mons), if any.
                      * If there are mons on the character card, you may use
                        those to pay for the card itself.
              2. Moving your Oyakata and doing business:
                  * Moving:
                      * Move your Oyakata the **exact** number of spaces
                        indicated by your Izikama meeple.
                      * You may *increase* your movement by spending sandals
                        such that each sandal token spent allows you to move
                        1 more space.
                          * You may **not** decrease your movement with sandals.
                      * You can end your movement on a space with any number of
                        Oyakatas.
                      * If your Oyakata passes the
                        ![exp up](/static/img/iki/exp_up.png) space, increase
                        the experience of **all** of your characters by
                        moving all your Kobuns up 1 space.
                          * If your Kobun reaches the top (circle) spot, [retire
                            that character](#retire).
                          * This is done **before** doing business.
                  * Doing business: you may do business with the shop you
                    stopped at **and/or** with 1 of the 2 characters (if any)
                    in the stalls.
                      * You can do business with the shop/charcter in any order.
                      * If you do business with another player's character,
                        the character increases their experience (move the
                        Kobun up) after doing business. If the Kobun has
                        reached the top slot, [retire that character](#retire).
                      * If you do business with 1 of *your* characters, that
                        character does **not** gain experience.
              3. Return your Izikama meeple to your player board.

              1. If there is an event, resolve it.
              2. Place 1 mon on each remaining character card next to the
                 board (except for payday months).
              3. If this is a "payday" (end of month 3, 6, 9, 12), do the
                 following:
                  1. Remove all the remaining fish, pipe, and tobacco pouch
                     tokens from the board and replace them with the ones
                     for the next season (unless at the end of month 12, see
                     below).
                  2. Remove all unhired characters from the current season and
                     return them to the box.
                  3. **If it is the end of month 12**:
                      * Return all winter cards to the box.
                      * All the winter fish, pipe, and tobacco pouch cards
                        **remain** on the board.
                      * Each player takes back their Oyakata and places it
                        next to their player board.
                  4. Players collect salary from each of their character cards
                     on the main board or that are retired.
                      * The income is what is depicted in the slot above your
                        Kobun, or the top slot if retired.
                  5. Nagaya harmony bonus:
                      * For each grouping (4 Nagayas + the 4 inner corners)
                        that has at least 2 characters of the same type (color),
                        each player with Kobuns in that color group scores: 
                        Number of Their Kobuns x The Number of That Card Type.
                          * e.g. if Player 1 had 2 Kobuns on brown characters in
                            a Nagaya with a total of 3 brown characters, they
                            would score 6 points.
                          * Note that characters in the corner spaces (making
                            up the 5th Nagaya) may score twice.
                  6. Food payment: each player must spend 1 rice for each
                     of their characters on the main board.
                      * **You do not have to pay rice for retired characters**.
                      * Characters **must** be fed, if possible. If a player
                        does not have enough rice, they remove a number of
                        characters from the main board equal to the number of
                        unfed characters.
                          * The player may choose which characters are
                            removed.
                          * Removed characters are returned to the box.
                          * The player returns the Kobun on this character to
                            their player board.
                          * **If a character with a firefighting power hiring
                            bonus leaves the game, its player's remains
                            where it is**.

              When a Kobun reaches the top slot of a character card, retirement
              occurs and the following happens.

              1. Remove the character from the board.
                  * Place it in the corresponding (color) column of your player
                    board.
              2. Return the Kobun back to your player board's supply.
