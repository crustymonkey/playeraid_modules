          All the rules here cover the full game, *not* the Training mission.

          * Someone should volunteer to be the recruiter; all other players
            will be rogue agents.
          * Place the board on the table with the recruiter's side closest
            to the recruiter.
          * Place the 5 mayhem tokens, starting with the recruiter and
            proceeding clockwise until each player has placed 1 token.
          * Place the time token next to the "01:00-05:00" spot on the
            time track.
          * Place each of the rogue agents' action cards under the matching
            labels on the rogue agents' side of the board.
          * Place each of the mind mgmt cards under the matching
            labels on the recruiter's side of the board.
          * Place the mental note, step, and recruit tokens in a supply near
            the board.
              * There should be 12 recruits in the supply.

          ## Recruiter Setup

          * Take the secret map, mental screen, and a dry erase marker.
              * Place the map behind their screen oriented to match the board.
          * Mark all the locations of the mayhem tokens on the secret map.
              * The recruiter cannot pass through mayhem tokens on their turns.
          * Take 1 mind slip token and and place it in front of the mental
            screen, visible to everyone.
          * Choose 1 recruiter card (or take 1 randomly) and place it behind
            the mental screen so that the rogue agents can't see it.
              * Return the unselected card to the box.
          * Choose a starting location by writing a "1" on any location on
            the secret map. This is **not** revealed to the rogue agents.
          * Shuffle the feature cards and draw 3 at random. Place them face
            up behind the screen.
              * These are not shown to/shared with the rogue agents.
              * Circle every feature on the secret map that matches any of
                the 3 cards.
          * Perform 4 ["step"](#steps) (movement) actions by writing "2",
            "3", "4", and "5" on the secret map.
              * You cannot visit the same location twice.
              * Collect recruits by visiting locations with circled features.
              * Place the number of recruits collected next to the
                "01:00-05:00" spot on the time track and put the time token on
                the "01:00-05:00" spot.
          * Place 4 immortal figures on the board with the following
            restrictions:
              * Each immortal must be placed in a different location.
              * Immortals cannot be placed on the outside edges of the
                board.

          ## Rogue Agents Setup

          * Take 1 dry-erase marker to share.
          * Distribute the 4 agent cards as evenly as possible between players.
              * This can be done randomly or players can be choose.
          * Each rogue agent does the following:
              * Place their agent card with the ability text face up.
              * Take the matching agent figure and place them on any location
                on the outside edge of the board.
          * Place both potential recruiter cards under the POTENTIAL label on
            the rogue agents' side of the board. (This lets the rogue agents
            know which special ability the recruiter might have).
          * Place any ally cards the agents have access to face up under the
            ALLIES label.
          * Place the 2nd mind slip token on a location on the board that is
            adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to 1 of the Temples.
          * The recruiter then draws an additional 2 feature cards and places
            them face up under the IMMORTAL RECRUITING label on their side.

          The recruiter starts the game with their 1st turn.
    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
          The game is played over a number of rounds and can end in a
          number of different ways.

          * The recruiter recruits 12 recruits -- the recruiter wins
            immediately.
          * The recruiter reaches 16:00 on the time track without being
            caught -- the recruiter wins.
              * **IMPORTANT**: The rogue agents do **not** get to take a turn
                after the time token reaches 16:00
          * An agent performs the [capture action](#a_capture)  while they
            are on the same space as the recruiter -- the rogue agents win
            immediately.

          A round consists of:

          1. Recruiter 1st turn: The recruiter takes 1 action and advances the
             time token.
          2. Rogue agents' 1st turn: The rogue agents activate any 2 of their
             agents.
          3. Recruiter 2nd turn: The recruiter takes 1 action, advances the
             time token, and resolves an Alert icon.
          4. Rogue agents' 2nd turn: The rogue agents activate their
             **remaining** 2 agents.
          5. Round end: Stand up each of the agent figures on the board and
             begin the next round.

                  There are 2 options for actions, *step* or *step using your
                  mind slip*.

                  * If you visit the location on the board with the 2nd mind
                    slip token that was placed during [setup](#setup), you
                    may "acquire" it for a 2nd mind slip action during the
                    game.
                      * **Do not remove the token from the board or tell the
                        agents you have visited the space with the 2nd
                        token!**
                      * On any subsequent turn, you may use it by discarding
                        it next to the current space on the time track (see
                        the [mind slip action](#mind_slip) below).

                      * Move to an orthogonally adjacent location on your secret
                        map and write down the next highest number there.
                        e.g. "7" if the last location was "6" (this will
                        always match the time token).
                          * You may **not** move diagonally, unless you are
                            moving to/from a Temple.
                          * You may **not** move to a location you've already
                            visited (a location with a number written on it).
                          * You **may** move to a location occupied by an agent.
                            Do **not** reveal that you have done so.
                          * You may **not** move through mayhem. In fact,
                            **no one can move through mayhem (recruiter,
                            agents, or immortals)**.
                      * If you become boxed in such that you have no legal move,
                        the rogue agents win immediately.
                      * If you visit a location with 1+ circled features
                        (matching the features behind your screen), contact 1
                        recruit for **each** feature.
                      * Temples allow for both orthogonal *and* diagonal
                        movement both to/from them.

                      * **Instead of a normal step action**, you can discard
                        your mind slip token to use the mind slip action.
                        The action details will be on your recruiter card.
                      * When you use the mind slip action:
                          1. Write the next number on your new location, but do
                             **not** write any numbers on the locations
                             *between* your old and new locations.
                              * You cannot contact recruits in any locations
                                *between* your old and new locations.
                          2. After you advance the time token, place your
                             discarded mind slip token next to the time track.
                      * You may **not** pretend to use your mind slip or just
                        use part of the ability. It must be used to its full
                        extent.

                  The recruiter controls all 4 immortals, which can be used
                  to contact recruits and disrupt agents.

                  Immortals have the following effects:

                  * It prevents the agent in the same location from using
                    *ask*, *reveal*, or *capture* actions (see [agents'
                    turn](#agent_turn)).
                  * The agent may not *ask* about **any** features in a
                    location with any immortal anywhere on the board.
                  * They can contact recruits by visiting the features
                    shown on the immortal recruiting cards.
                      * However, **they must visit a location with at least
                        2 matching features** at the same time (see
                        [immortal recruiting](#imm_recruiting) for more info).

                      An immortal:

                      * May move to an orthogonally **or** diagonally
                        adjacent location.

                      * In order for immortals to contact a recruit, they
                        must occupy 2 different locations (at the **same**
                        time) that **both** have a feature shown on 1 of
                        the feature cards under IMMORTAL RECRUITING.
                          * If this is satisfied, immediately place 1 recruit
                            from the supply on the matching feature icon in
                            the top right part of the board.
                          * Then, discard that feature card from the immortal
                            recruiting area, but leave it face up.
                          * This recruit is counted towards the 12 recruits
                            needed for the recruiter to win.
                              * **If this is the 12th recruit, the recruiter
                                wins immediately**.
                          * Immortals may not contact recruits at this feature
                            again.
                      * The recruiter may use their immortals to contact a
                        recruit at any time during their turn.
                          * This means that the recruiter could use immortals
                            to contact recruits **twice** on their turn.
                      * Immortals cannot use the recruiter's feature cards.

                      revealing a location you've visited.

                      1. Place 1 Step token on any location you have visited

                  Your agent may move up to 2 spaces.

                  * Each move must be orthogonal, unless moving to/from a

                        use the ask action**.
                      * **You may not ask about any feature in any location

                        on the board, is on a location with a *billboard* and

                        feature, they must place a step token on 1 of the

                          * The location cannot already have a step token.
                          * The location cannot have a [green]!green! confirmed
                            mental note on it.

                        step/confirmed tokens on them, the recruiter says
                        they cannot place a token, but **not why**.
                      * A Temple is **not** a feature.

                      An agent must be at a space with an immortal to use
                      the shakedown action.

                      Follow these steps for a shakedown:

                      1. Chose any feature on the board and ask if it matches
                         any of the 3 feature cards the recruiter has behind
                         their screen.
                          * This does **not** have to be a feature at your
                            current location, it can be any feature.
                      2. If a card is correctly identified, the recruiter
                         reveals it and places it face up next to the board.
                          * **The recruiter may no longer use this feature
                            to contact recruits**.
                          * The recruiter should draw an "X" through each
                            circled feature on their secret map that they have
                            not yet visited.
                      3. You may push the immortal from your location in
                         any orthogonal direction.
                          * All [immortal movement rules](#imm_move) must be
                            followed.
                              * You may not push an immortal through mayhem.
                              * You may not push an immortal into a space with
                                another immortal
                          * This action can be taken **whether or not the card
                            was correctly identified**.

                      * **You cannot use this action if you share a space with
                        an immortal**.
                      * If the recruiter is at this location, they are captured
                        and the rogue agents immediately win the game.
                      * If the recruiter is not at this location, they declare
                        it a *miss* and play continues.
                          * (tip) Use mental notes to mark missed captures.
