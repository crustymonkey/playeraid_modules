      * **If playing with 2 players**, you will setup the board and kennel
        as if you were playing with 4 players.
      * Shuffle the science deck and place it face down on its space on the
        board.
      * Shuffle the study deck and place it face down on its space on the
        board.
      * Shuffle the octagonal supply tiles and place them face down on
        on the space on the board with the gear icon (without the red X).
          * Fill the track to the right of the stack with face up supply
            tiles for your player count, **but leave the 1st space empty**.

  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over 5 rounds, with each round consisting of 4 phases.
      You will be trying to breed the friendliest foxes, completing the most
      studies, and attracting patrons.
    sections:
      - name: "Phase 1: Selection"
        text: |
          * This consists of 3 rounds in turn order where each player selects
            **1** of the following items on their turn. Each player **must
            select 1 of each item across their 3 turns**, but they can
            be selected in any order.
              * 1 female fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * 1 male fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * A supply track position. Note that you *can* use the 1st space
                of the track here, but it grants no supplies. It will assure
                that you are 1st in turn order though.
                  1. Immediately collect all supplies shown on the space (all
                     icons on the supply tile and any printed on the board).
                     See the table below for icons.
                  2. Discard the supply tile.
                  3. Place your gear token on the space you took the tile from.
                     *You will keep your current turn order token until
                     the administration phase*.

          | Icon | Description |
          | ---- | ----------- |
          | ![science](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/science.png) | Draw 1 science card from the top of the deck.  Keep it secret until you decide to use it. |
          | ![friendly](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/friendly.png) | Take 1 friendly token from the supply. |
          | ![trait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/traits.png) | Take 1 trait token of type shown from the supply. |
          | ![wtrait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/wtrait.png) | Take 1 trait token of your choice from the supply. |

          ### Upgrades
          * Players are now able to unlock upgrades before moving on to the
            next phase.
              * In each of the 4 upgrade tracks, upgrades must be unlocked
                from left to right.
              * The circle to the right of the upgrade shows the cost (a
                number of trait tokens).  The diamond shows what is unlocked.
              * Upgrades can be unlocked any trait tokens, but they **must
                match**. e.g. If the cost is 2 tokens, you could use 2 tail
                tokens, but you could not use 1 tail token and 1 ear token.
                  * When upgrading place 1 of the tokens used to pay for it
                    on the circle, showing it is unlocked. Return the rest
                    to the supply.
                  * Upgrades cannot be partially unlocked.
              * You may unlock any number of spaces across any number of
                tracks (that you can afford).

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![pups](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/pups.png) | Each unlocked pup lets you breed 1 additional pup each round. |
          | ![studies](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/studies.png) | When you unlock a study upgrade, draw 3 new studies and keep 1, discarding the rest to the bottom of deck. |
          | ![fdice](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Each of these upgrades lets you roll 1 more friendly die each time you make a pup. When this is unlocked, take a friendly die and add it to your stash. |
          | ![patrons](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Choose 1 of the 4 patrons and place 1 of your fox meeples on the space next to them. Then gain the supplies on their supply tile + 1 science card. |

          1. Reveal the top card from your blank fox deck and place it to the
             right of your player board (note that parents are to the *left* of
             your board).
          2. Gather together your dice:
              * Take friendly dice to match the number unlocked on your player
                mat (if you don't already have them).
              * Gather all trait dice shown on both parent foxes you selected.
                  * For player-made foxes, it is the number of marked squares
                    on the card. **Marked circles do not give you dice**.
          3. Roll all your dice and sort them by trait. Match up dice to make
             complete traits.
              * A single die with 2 halves does not make a trait.
              * Friendly dice and tokens are used as wilds.
              * A friendly die with 2 halves can be matched to 2 **different**
                trait dice.  e.g. purple on 1 side, pink on the other.
              * If you make a complete trait with only friendly dice/tokens,
                it counts as any trait.
              * Any friendly tokens you used to make traits are discarded.
              * Round trait tokens are rewards only and **cannot** be used
                during this step.
          4. Once you are done with step 3, record the results on your blank
             fox card.
              * Mark each square matching a trait with an "X".  This will
                give the player that selects 1 trait die for each marked
                square.
              * Mark each circle with a dot.  This will gain trait tokens
                based on your best row of marked circles for each trait
                in the research phase. *Do not gain the tokens now*.
              * Do **not** record any incomplete half symbols.
              * If you make more than 5 symbols of a single trait type (filling
                the track), gain 1 point token for each symbol you were not
                able to mark. Also write the number of point tokens you
                collected to the right of the track.
          5. Count the total number of trait symbols your pup has (on all 4
             tracks) and write the number in box in the top right of the card.
             This is the pup's friendliness score.
              * If you filled a track and earned point tokens, include the
                number of point tokens in this score.
          6. Give your pup a name and write it on the card.

          ### Breeding Multiple Pups
          * When breeding multiple pups, you complete all steps (1-6) for
            each pup, 1 pup at a time.
              * Clarification: This means that you will re-roll the same dice
                pool for each pup individually.
              * If you used science cards or friendliness tokens, these
                are discarded **before moving on to the next pup**.  e.g
                they cannot be used for multiple pups.
      - name: "Phase 3: Research (simultaneous)"
        text: |
          1. To complete a study level, you must assign **1** of your pups
             to a study that meets **all** of the requirements in the next
             column of a study:
              * Use a fox meeple to track your progress on studies.
              * Each study level shows a minimum number of marked spaces
                on 2 or more trait tracks.
                  * Your pup must at least the marked spaces shown.
              * The pup must be able complete the level **on its own**. 
                You can't add together multiple pups.
              * Each pup can only complete 1 level of study.
                  * You cannot complete multiple levels of a study card with
                    a single pup.
                  * You cannot assign a single pup to multiple study cards.
              * Each study's levels must be complete in order, left
                to right.
                  * You cannot skip ahead if your pup qualifies for a level
                    you haven't reached yet.
              * Once a study level is complete, you can't complete it again.
                  * Once you've completed the 3rd level of study, the card
                    is complete.
              * Do **not** take point tokens when completing study levels.
                The fox meeple tracks your points to be scored at the end
                of the game.
          2. Collect trait tokens.
              * If you bred only 1 pup, collect 1 trait token for each marked
                circle on each of the 4 trait tracks.
              * If you bred multiple pups, you gain trait tokens from only
                the fox that that has the most circles marked for each trait.
              * (Optional) If a player breeds 2 parents in the same player
                color, they must pay a penalty by discarding 2 trait tokens
                of their choice after collecting tokens. They must be discarded
                before the next step.
          3. Unlock upgrades (same as phase 1).  See below

          ### Upgrades
          * Players are now able to unlock upgrades before moving on to the
            next phase.
              * In each of the 4 upgrade tracks, upgrades must be unlocked
                from left to right.
              * The circle to the right of the upgrade shows the cost (a
                number of trait tokens).  The diamond shows what is unlocked.
              * Upgrades can be unlocked any trait tokens, but they **must
                match**. e.g. If the cost is 2 tokens, you could use 2 tail
                tokens, but you could not use 1 tail token and 1 ear token.
                  * When upgrading place 1 of the tokens used to pay for it
                    on the circle, showing it is unlocked. Return the rest
                    to the supply.
                  * Upgrades cannot be partially unlocked.
              * You may unlock any number of spaces across any number of
                tracks (that you can afford).

      - name: "Phase 4: Administration"
        text: |
          1. Discard all foxes from the previous generation and return all
             trait dice to the supply.
              * Any unselected foxes are discarded (male and female).
                  * Foxes from the parent decks are discarded to a pile near
                    the appropriate deck.
                  * Foxes made by a player are returned to a **private
                    discard** pile near that players blank foxes.

          2. All players place all new pups made this round into the kennel
             area in their appropriate male/female rows.
          3. Find the fox with the highest friendliness score of all pups
             made this round and the player who made that fox places 1 of
             their fox meeples on the next empty space on the friendliness
             rewards track.
              * The points indicated will be scored at the end of the game (not
                now).
              * If 2 or more players are tied for friendliest, all players
                place a meeple on the track in the same space (next empty).
              * If 1 player has multiple tied foxes, they still place only
                1 meeple.
              * **All other players** receive the friendliness tokens shown
                below the fox slot for the current round.
          4. Refill the kennel such that there is at least 1 more fox than
             the number of players in each row.

                foxes from the parent deck.
              * If there are > 8 foxes in 1 row of the kennel, you must discard
                down to 8, starting with the foxes with the lowest
                friendliness scores.
                  * If, due to ties in friendliness scores, you end up under
                    the minimum, fill to the minimum from the parent deck.
          5. Redistribute turn order tokens to match the player order on the
             supply track.
              * Also discard any unclaimed supply tiles left on the supply
                track.
              * Each player takes back their gear token from the supply track.

      closest to the beginning of the supply track wins.
  - name: 2 Player Rules
    text: |
      The 2 player mode incorporates an automated opponent.

      ## Setup
      * Setup the board and kennel as if you are playing a 4 player game.
      * Assign an unused player color to the AI. You can leave the player
        mat in the box though.
      * Shuffle the AI's selection deck and place it near the board.
      * Shuffle the AI's study deck and place it near the selection deck.
          * Reveal the top study and place it face up next to the deck.
      * Place the AI's gear token and 5 of its fox meeples near the selection
        deck. Any remaining fox meeples can be returned to the box.
      * Give the "3rd" turn order token to the AI.

      ## Phase 1: Selection
      * The AI will take 3 turns, just like a player, during this phase.
      * Each turn, the AI select **2 items instead of 1**. e.g. 2 male foxes,
        2 female foxes, 2 positions on the supply track.
      * At the start of the AI's turn, flip the top card of the selection deck
        and the AI selects the 2 items shown on the card, once each.
          * If something on the card was already selected twice, the AI instead
            selects something it still needs.
      * To select foxes, use the AI's study card and it's 1st and 2nd preferred
        traits by following the steps below. Note that the AI does **not**
        remove the cards, but instead places 1 of its meeples on the card.
        Players cannot select a fox with an AI meeple on it.
          1. The fox with the most dice of its study card's #1 preference. If
             tied, move to step 2.
          2. The fox with the most dice of its study card's #2 preference. If
             tied, move to step 3.
          3. The 1st fox indicated by the arrow showing on the top of the
             AI selection deck. e.g. for a left pointing arrow, start at the
             right side and pick the 1st tied fox.
      * To claim a supply track position, the AI claims either the left most
        or right most available space on the track, based on the arrow showing
        on the selection deck.
          * The AI does not collect supplies. Discard the supply tile (if
            present).
          * For the **1st** selection for this track place an AI meeple on
            the space.
          * For the **2nd** selection for this track place the AI gear token,
            which will determine its turn order in the next round.

      ## Phase 2: Breeding
      * The AI simulates breeding by adding extra trait dice to the foxes
        it selected, leaving them in the kennel.
      * For each of the 4 selected foxes:
          * If it is a fox from the deck, take 1 die of each of the AI's 2
            priority traits and place them on the fox card.
          * If it is a player fox, mark the next empty square on each of
            of the trait track matching the AI's priority traits.
          * Each fox (from the deck or a player) can have a max of 2 dice
            of each trait.
              * If a fox already has 2 dice for a trait matching the AI's
                priorities, the fox does **not** get another die of that
                trait.
          * Do not remove the fox meeples from the AI's foxes.

      ## Phase 3: Research
      * If any player completes the 3rd level of a study card during this
        phase, place the AI's study card on the bottom of the deck and
        reveal a new 1 to replace it.

      ## Phase 4: Administration
      Follow normal administration with these changes:

      * When clearing foxes from the kennel, do not clear any foxes with an
        AI meeple on them.  Instead, shift them to the left end of the row.
      * The AI does not participate in friendliness rewards.
      * After friendliness rewards are complete, remove the AI meeples from
        the foxes.
      * When setting the new turn order the AI gets the token pertaining
        to where its gear token is (not where it has its meeple). Return
        both the meeple and gear token to the AI's supply.

      ## Game End
      The AI does not score points.  All scoring is done as normal.
