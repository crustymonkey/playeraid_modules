      The game is played over a number of rounds until 1 of the following
      occurs:
      * A player reaches the top of all 3 mission tracks.
      * A player is the last remaining player, with all others eliminated.
      * A player plays 4 atium on the "CONFRONTATION" card and wins
        immediately.

      ## General Rules
      * Players can look through their own hand and discard pile at any time.
      * Cards can be played on a player's turn in any order.
      * Whenever a player gains a card, it goes into their face up discard
        pile immediately, unless specified otherwise.
      * At the end of a player's turn, all cards, except Allies, are moved
        to the player's discard pile.
      * Players draw 5 new cards from their deck to end their turn.
      * Whenever a player would need to draw a card from their deck and the
        deck is empty, they should shuffle their discard into a new deck.
      * If a card is "eliminated", it is put in a general eliminated pile
        shared by all players.
          * Anyone can look through the eliminated pile at any time.

      ## A Player's Turn
      1. Move 1 space to the right on the training track.
      2. In any order, any number of times:
          * Play cards from hand
          * Burn or flare metals on cards
          * Use a card as a metal
          * Discard a card to refresh a flared metal
          * Activate ally and character abilities
          * Move up on the mission tracks
          * Buy cards and boxings from the market
      3. Attack allies
      4. Attack players (reducing their health)
          * The target may be moved after this step if the target holder
            took damage
      5. Discard any cards in play (except allies) and any remaining cards
         in hand.
          * Return metal tokens to their place on the training track.
      6. Draw 5 new cards from their deck.
    sections:
      - name: Metals
        text: |
          Metals, in terms of the tokens and on cards, can be used in a
          variety of ways in the game.

          * You can only burn a number of metal tokens equal to the number of
            "+1 metal" [icons](#icons) (the limit is **1** at the beginning of
            the game) you've unlocked on your training track.
              * You can exceed this limit by "flaring" a metal (see below).
          * To burn a metal (token), remove it from the training track and
            place it on the card in your play area you want to use it on.
              * These are returned to your training track at the end of your
                turn.
          * You can use metals shown on cards for a metal requirement on
            a card by placing it sideways under the card you wish to use the
            metal on.
              * There is no limit to the number of cards that can be used in
                this way on your turn.
              * **Using cards in this way does not count against your metal
                usage limit**.
          * **A metal token or card can be burned for no effect** just to
            activate savant abilities and ally effects.

          ## Flaring
          To exceed the "+1 metal" icon limit (above), you can "flare" a
          metal.

          * Take an unflared metal token and flip it over, placing it on the
            card you wish to power (or empty space if flaring for no effect).
              * This works in the same way as "burning" a metal.
          * At the end of your turn, the token is **returned on it's currently
            flipped side**.
          * A flared metal cannot be used again for any use until it is
            refreshed (below).
          * A flared metal counts as burning a metal for all effects.
          * There is no limit to the number of metals that can be flared on
            your turn.

          ## Refreshing
          Refreshing is the method of flipping a flared metal back to its
          usable side.

          * To refresh a metal, discard a card from your hand with a matching
            metal in the bottom right of the card.
          * Refreshing a metal **does not count as burning a metal** for any
            purpose.
          * There are effects that will also allow you to refresh a metal.
            See the [icons](#icons) for the refresh icon.
          * You may refresh a metal you've flared on the same turn, but you
            may not use it again this turn.
          * If you refresh a metal that **you have not used this turn**, you
            may then use it.

          ## Atium
          * Atium is gained from the training track and certain missions.
          * Atium is used to power atium cards OR as a wild token in place of
            another metal token.
              * When used as a wild, it is considered **both** an atium
                **and** the token it is being used as (for abilities).
          * Used atium is returned to the supply at the end of your turn. Each
            atium token is single use.
          * Atium tokens **cannot be flared**. You must have metal token burns
            available to use an atium token.
          * Atium cards can be used to power any card or refresh any metal
            token (as a wild metal).

          | Symbol | Metal | Description | Power |
          | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ----- |
          | ![tin](/static/img/mistborn/tin.png) | Tin | Tin cards focus on mission points and coins, often providing different effects based on your position on the mission tracks. | **Sense**: Stops other players from advancing on the mission track, affecting the whole turn. |
          | ![pewter](/static/img/mistborn/pewter.png) | Pewter | Pewter cards provide both combat and healing. | **Defender**: Both pewter allies are defenders, which means that damage cannot target your non-defender allies while they are in play. |
          | ![bronze](/static/img/mistborn/bronze.png) | Bronze | Bronze cards give you mission points and allow you to use abilities in the market. | **Seek**: Seek allows you to use the top effect of any action card (**not ally**) in the market up to the listed cost. |
          | ![copper](/static/img/mistborn/copper.png) | Copper | Copper cards provide a variety of effects, including healing and blocking damage. | **Cloud**: This either prevents damage to a player or their allies (depending on the card). If player damage is reduced to zero for the targeted player, they cannot pass the target. |
          | ![zinc](/static/img/mistborn/zinc.png) | Zinc | Zinc cards provide mainly coins and a way to use allies without burning metals. | **Riot**: Allows you to activate any ally's top effect, if it hasn't been used yet, without burning metals. You may not activate this effect again this turn, even by burning a metal. |
          | ![brass](/static/img/mistborn/brass.png) | Brass | Brass cards provide mission points and coins, as well as the ability to eliminate cards. | **Soothe**: Allows you to eliminate any of your cards from your hand, discard, or in play.  If you eliminate a cards in play, **you still get its effect**. |
          | ![iron](/static/img/mistborn/iron.png) | Iron | Iron cards are combat focused and allow you to prepare for future turns | **Pull**: Allows you to move cards from your discard pile to the top of your deck. |
          | ![steel](/static/img/mistborn/steel.png) | Steel | Steel cards provide combat, coins, and ways to affect the market, and even ways to gain eliminated cards. | **Push**: Allows you to eliminate any card from the market. Replace eliminated cards immediately. |
          | ![atium](/static/img/mistborn/atium.png) | Atium | Atium cards provide powerful mission points and combat points, but need atium to play them. Atium cards can also be used to power any other card or to refresh any flared metal token (when discarded). | |
      - name: Cards
        text: |
          There are 2 kinds of cards in the market deck: Actions and allies.
          Action cards are vertically oriented while ally cards are always
          horizontal.

          * Some cards have multiple effects for burning separate instances of
            a metal. These **must be activated from top to the bottom**. You
            cannot just activate the second ability.
          * Some cards have savant abilities (shown in the bottom of the metal
            vial on the card) that are activated **only when the card is used
            as a metal**
              * You cannot use this if it's discarded to refresh a card or used
                for its main abilities.
          * Some cards have an effect that can be played off-turn (always
            indicated with a vertically oriented ability name bar).
              * To use these, just discard the card at the relevant time.
              * No metal needs to be burned to use a card this way.

          ## Allies
          * Ally cards are placed above your character card.
          * They cannot be used as a metal or to refresh cards.
          * They are not powered directly by metals as action cards are.
          * For abilities that you gain when burning a metal, you only gain the
            effect **once**, no matter how many times you burn that metal.
          * Some allies have an ability that is activated only when a second
            instance of a metal is burned.
          * Some allies have ongoing effects that don't require a metal to be
            burned.
      - name: "Characters & the Training Track"
        text: |
          * At the beginning of every turn, players will move their tracker
            cube 1 space forward on the training track.
          * You may also move up on the track whenever a card or mission effect
            has the ["train" icon](#icons).
          * You will unlock various abilities as you advance:
              * Burning additional metal tokens ("+1 icon")
              * Character abilities (I, II, III)
              * Atium: Gain an atium when reaching these.
              * If you reach the end of the track, any time you would move up,
                gain an atium token instead.

          ## Characters
          They have various abilities (I, II, III) that are unlocked from
          moving up the training track.

          * Characters have a signature metal that activates when you burn
            that particular metal.
              * As it is with allies, you can **only activate this once**, no
                matter how many times you burn that metal on your turn.
          * The 2nd ability (II):  Once per turn, a player may immediately
            eliminate an action card they buy from the market.  When they do,
            complete that card's top effect without burning any metal.
          * Every character has an atium effect that is triggered when burning
            atium.
      - name: Missions
        text: |
          Each game has 3 random missions.

          * Tracking cubes always start on the image, **not** the bottom of the
            track, on each mission.
          * It takes 12 mission points to reach the top of the track.
          * Mid track rewards:
              * Some spaces have a special reward if you are the 1st player to
                reach that space (left side of the row).
              * There are also rewards for anyone that reaches marked
                mid-points on the track (right side).
          * There is an additional reward for the 1st player to reach the top
            of the track.
      - name: Combat
        text: |
          One of the ways to win is to be the last character standing.

          * If a player reaches zero health, they are eliminated from the game.
          * Players may receive damage points that can be used at the end of
            their turn.
              * Damage points may be split between allies and players.
          * Each ally has a health equal to their defense value (upper left).
              * **Allies cannot take partial damage**.  They must be killed,
                otherwise damage has no effect.
              * Killed allies go directly to the owner's discard pile.
          * Allies with the "Defender" ability.  These allies **must** be
            killed before any other allies or the character can be attacked.
          * Some effects give you health, but **you can never have more than
            40 health**.

          # 2 Player Games
          * At the end of your turn, you may (but do not have to) direct all
            your combat at your opponent and their allies.

          # 3-4 Player Games
          * There is an added mechanic called the "target".
          * The last player starts with the target.
          * At the end of your turn, you may target **anyone's** allies, but
            you **must** direct character damage at the player holding the
            target.
          * After a player with the target takes any amount of damage to
            their character (dial), they may pass the target to another
            player.
              * **Target passing only happens after all damage has been used
                for that turn**.
          * If you have the target on your turn, after attacking allies, your
            damage points deal their full damage to **every other player**.
              * If a player has defender allies, damage is dealt to them first.
              * If a "Cloud" off-turn ability is used, it only prevents
                damage to themselves, not anyone else.
          * If there are only 2 players left in the game (due to players being
            eliminated), remove the target from the game.
      - name: "Market & Boxings"
        text: |
          * Market cards can be purchased and immediately added to your discard
            pile.
          * Coins gained on cards and spent boxings contribute to your total
            buying power.
          * When is card is bought from the market, it is immediately replaced
            with a new card from the deck.
          * You may buy any number of cards.
          * Boxings may be purchased by spending **2** coins.
              * This allows you to save money for any future purchase.
              * You can save boxings for as long as you'd like.
              * When spent, return them to the supply.
  - name: End of the Game
    text: |
      The game ends when 1 of the following happens:

      * A player instantly wins by reaching the top of all 3 mission tracks.
      * A player is the last 1 standing.
      * A player instantly wins by playing 4 atium on the card "CONFRONTATION".
