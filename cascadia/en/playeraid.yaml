          * Place all the wildlife tokens in the bag.
          * Randomly select habitat tiles based on player count, then place
            them in stacks face down:
              * 2 players: 43 (remove 42)
              * 3 players: 63 (remove 22)
              * 4 players: 83 (remove 2)
          * Randomly choose 1 wildlife scoring card for each of the 5 wildlife
            and place these in the play area.
          * Randomly distribute 1 starter habitat tile to each player.
          * Reveal 4 habitat tiles and place them in the center play area.
          * Draw 4 wildlife tokens and pair them with the 4 habitat tiles.
          * Place the nature tokens in the center play area.
          * Choose a start player.

          1. Check to see if there are too many matching wildlife tokens:
              * If all 4 tokens are the same, they are set aside and 4 new
                tokens are drawn and paired in order. Repeat this as necessary.
              * If 3 tokens are the same, the active player *may* set aside
                those 3 tokens and replace them. This may only be done once
                per turn.
              * **When finished**, add all set aside tokens back to the bag.
          2. Select a pairing of habitat tile and wildlife token. You may
             optionally spend a nature token to do one of the following
             instead:
              * Take **any** 1 of the 4 habitat tiles and **any** 1 of the
                4 wildlife tokens.
              * Wipe any number of wildlife tokens and replace them. (see
                step #1 above)
          3. Place the tile and token into your environment.
              * The habitat tile must be placed adjacent to any previously
                placed tile.
              * You cannot place a habitat tile on top of another tile.
              * The wildlife token may be placed onto a habitat tile:
                  * The tile you are placing it on cannot already have a token
                    on it.
                  * The tile must show the matching wildlife.
                  * If you cannot legally place the wildlife token, or you
                    choose not to, return the token to the bag.
                  * You may place the token on the tile you just placed.
                  * If you place the token on a keystone tile, take a nature
                    token.
          4. Put out a replacement habitat tile from a face down stack
             and a wildlife token from the bag.
    - name: Game End
      id: game_end
      text: |
          If there are no face down habitat tiles to replace the one taken at
          the end of a player's turn, the game ends (each player should have
          20 turns).

          Using the score pad, score the following:

          1. Wildlife scoring cards:
              * Score each wildlife based on the wildlife scoring cards.
          2. Nature tokens:
              * Score 1 point per unused nature token.
          3. Habitat tiles:
              * Score 1 point per habitat tile in your largest contiguous
                habitat group for each of the 5 habitats.
          4. Habitat tile majorities:
              * Points are awarded for majorities in the 5 habitats based on
                player count:
                  * **3-4 players**: 3 points for the most and 1 point for 2nd
                      * If 2 players tie for largest habitat, score 2 points
                        for each of them.
                      * If 3-4 players tie, 1 point each.
                  * **2 players**: 2 points for the most and 0 points for 2nd
                      * All ties are 1 point each.

          Whoever has the most points wins.  If there is a tie, the player
          with the most unused nature tokens wins. If there is still a tie,
          the players share the victory.
