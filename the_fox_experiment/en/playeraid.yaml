  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over 5 rounds, with each round consisting of 4 phases.
      You will be trying to breed the friendliest foxes, completing the most
      studies, and attracting patrons.
    sections:
      - name: "Phase 1: Selection"
        text: |
          * This consists of 3 rounds in turn order where each player selects
            **1** of the following items on their turn. Each player **must
            select 1 of each item across their 3 turns**, but they can
            be selected in any order.
              * 1 female fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * 1 male fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * A supply track position. Note that you *can* use the 1st space
                of the track here, but it grants no supplies. It will assure
                that you are 1st in turn order though.
                  1. Immediately collect all supplies shown on the space (all
                     icons on the supply tile and any printed on the board).
                     See the table below for icons.
                  2. Discard the supply tile.
                  3. Place your gear token on the space you took the tile from.
                     *You will keep your current turn order token until
                     the administration phase*.

          | Icon | Description |
          | ---- | ----------- |
          | ![science](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/science.png) | Draw 1 science card from the top of the deck.  Keep it secret until you decide to use it. |
          | ![friendly](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/friendly.png) | Take 1 friendly token from the supply. |
          | ![trait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/traits.png) | Take 1 trait token of type shown from the supply. |
          | ![wtrait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/wtrait.png) | Take 1 trait token of your choice from the supply. |

          ### Upgrades
          * Players are now able to unlock upgrades before moving on to the
            next phase.
              * In each of the 4 upgrade tracks, upgrades must be unlocked
                from left to right.
              * The circle to the right of the upgrade shows the cost (a
                number of trait tokens).  The diamond shows what is unlocked.
              * Upgrades can be unlocked any trait tokens, but they **must
                match**. e.g. If the cost is 2 tokens, you could use 2 tail
                tokens, but you could not use 1 tail token and 1 ear token.
                  * When upgrading place 1 of the tokens used to pay for it
                    on the circle, showing it is unlocked. Return the rest
                    to the supply.
                  * Upgrades cannot be partially unlocked.
              * You may unlock any number of spaces across any number of
                tracks (that you can afford).

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![pups](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/pups.png) | Each unlocked pup lets you breed 1 additional pup each round. |
          | ![studies](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/studies.png) | When you unlock a study upgrade, draw 3 new studies and keep 1, discarding the rest to the bottom of deck. |
          | ![fdice](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Each of these upgrades lets you roll 1 more friendly die each time you make a pup. When this is unlocked, take a friendly die and add it to your stash. |
          | ![patrons](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Choose 1 of the 4 patrons and place 1 of your fox meeples on the space next to them. Then gain the supplies on their supply tile + 1 science card. |

          1. Reveal the top card from your blank fox deck and place it to the
             right of your player board (note that parents are to the *left* of
             your board).
          2. Gather together your dice:
              * Take friendly dice to match the number unlocked on your player
                mat (if you don't already have them).
              * Gather all trait dice shown on both parent foxes you selected.
          3. Roll all your dice and sort them by trait. Match up dice to make
             complete traits.
              * A single die with 2 halves does not make a trait.
              * Friendly dice and tokens are used as wilds.
              * A friendly die with 2 halves can be matched to 2 **different**
                trait dice.  e.g. purple on 1 side, pink on the other.
              * If you make a complete trait with only friendly dice/tokens,
                it counts as any trait.
              * Any friendly tokens you used to make traits are discarded.
              * Round trait tokens are rewards only and **cannot** be used
                during this step.
          4. Once you are done with step 3, record the results on your blank
             fox card.
              * Mark each square matching a trait with an "X".  This will
                give the player that selects 1 trait die for each marked
                square.
              * Mark each circle with a dot.  This will gain trait tokens
                based on your best row of marked circles for each trait
                in the research phase. *Do not gain the tokens now*.
              * Do **not** record any incomplete half symbols.
              * If you make more than 5 symbols of a single trait type (filling
                the track), gain 1 point token for each symbol you were not
                able to mark. Also write the number of point tokens you
                collected to the right of the track.
          5. Count the total number of trait symbols your pup has (on all 4
             tracks) and write the number in box in the top right of the card.
             This is the pup's friendliness score.
              * If you filled a track and earned point tokens, include the
                number of point tokens in this score.
          6. Give your pup a name and write it on the card.

          1. To complete a study level, you must assign **1** of your pups
             to a study that meets these requirements:
              * Use a fox meeple to track your progress on studies.
              * Each study level shows a minimum number of marked spaces
                on 2 or more trait tracks.
                  * Your pup must at least the marked spaces shown.
              * The pup must be able complete the level **on its own**. 
                You can't add together multiple pups.
              * Each pup can only complete 1 level of study.
                  * You cannot complete multiple levels of a study card with
                    a single pup.
                  * You cannot assign a single pup to multiple study cards.
              * Each study's levels must be complete in order, left
                to right.
                  * You cannot skip ahead if your pup qualifies for a level
                    you haven't reached yet.
              * Once a study level is complete, you can't complete it again.
                  * Once you've completed the 3rd level of study, the card
                    is complete.
              * Do **not** take point tokens when completing study levels.
                The fox meeple tracks your points to be scored at the end
                of the game.
          2. Collect trait tokens.
              * If you bred only 1 pup, collect 1 trait token for each marked
                circle on each of the 4 trait tracks.
