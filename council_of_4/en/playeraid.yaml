                *  Divide the business permit tiles into 3 decks based on the
                   region (color).  Shuffle the 3 decks separately and place
                   them face down on their corresponding spaces.  Draw 2

                   spaces on the center of the track board
                *  Insert 4 councilors at random in each council line (1 for
                   each region on the main board, and the Queen line on the
                   track board).  Place the 8 remaining councilors next to
                   the board
                *  Shuffle the politics cards and place the deck facedown
                   next to the board
