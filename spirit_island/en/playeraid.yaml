    - name: Gameplay
      text: |
        * When using Powers, you may always choose to skip them but do not get any Energy back.
        * Elements are never spent; an Element icon can power multiple effects.
        * When using a Power, you must choose a space within the appropriate range and any other targeting criteria.
        * When all of the Fear tokens have been moved to the Generated Fear, place the top Fear card from the deck face down into the earned space. Move all Fear tokens back to the Fear Pool and continue adding to the Generated Fear if necessary.
        * If a Blight token is added to a land that already has a Blight token, place a Blight token onto an adjacent land as well. This may cause a cascade.
            * If a Blight token is added to a space with Spirit Presence, each Spirit in that land must remove 1 of their discs in that space from the game.
            * If the Health Island card is emptied of Blight, immediately flip it to its Blighted Island side.
            * If the last Blight is removed from the Blighted Island card, carry out its effect.
        * If an Explorer would ever be placed into a space with a Wilds token, do not place the Explorer and discard a Wilds token.
        * If Invaders would ever build in a space with a Disease token, do not build and instead discard a Disease token.
        * If an Invader has a Strife token under them, they deal 0 damage and discard one of their Strife tokens. This happens even if the Invader would deal 0 damage because of a Defend X. If Invaders damage other Invaders, the Strife token has no effect and is not removed. Invaders bring any Strife tokens they have with them if they move. An Invader's Strife tokens are removed if they are replaced by something else.
        * The first time each Action Damages Invaders in a land, increase that Damage by 1 per Badlands. The first time each Action Damages Dahan in a land, increase that damage by 1 per Badlands. This only applies if at least 1 point of Damage is inflicted normally.
        * "Origin land" refers to the land with the Presence from which you're targeting the Power or measuring Range.
        * If a piece is saved from destruction, remove all damage from that piece; they cannot be destroyed or dealt damage a second time by the action they were just saved from.

                * You must do everything shown on the chosen action space(s) but may perform them in any order.
                * When placing Presence, you may instead choose to move a Presence already on the board.
            * Gain an amount of Energy equal to the highest uncovered number on your Energy Presence track.
            * May play a number of Power cards from your hand up to the maximum shown on your Spirit board. Must immediately pay the energy cost shown in the upper-left corner. You immediately gain the Elements shown on the left side of the card

            * If an Invader space has no cards, do not perform that action.
            * If an Invader space has multiple cards, you perform that action multiple times, starting with the bottommost card.
          sections:
            - name: Blighted Island
              text: |
                * If the Blight card is flipped to its Blighted Island side, follow its instructions.
            - name: Event
              text: |
                * Draw and resolve the top Event card. If a choice has a cost, players determine how to pay that cost amongst themselves.
                    * During the first round, just draw and discard the card without applying its effect.
            - name: Fear
              text: |
                * If any Fear cards have been earned, flip the earned Fear cards over so that they are in the order they were earned and resolve them one at a time. Place the resolved cards in the Fear discard space.
            - name: Ravage
              text: |
                * Invaders ravage each land of the type(s) shown on the card in the Ravage space.
                    * If an Invader has any number of Strife tokens, that Invader deals 0 damage and remove 1 of their Strife tokens.
                    * If a particular Invader's Damage is boosted, Strife applies afterwards and cancels it. If the total Damage is boosted, this boost applies after Strife.
                * Explorer: 1 damage, Town: 2 damage, City: 3 damage.
                * If a space is Defended, Defend cancels X damage to both the land and the Dahan.
                * If 2+ damage is dealt, place 1 Blight token onto the land.
                * Every 2 points of damage destroys 1 Dahan. If 1 or more Damage is done to them, they take +1 Damage/Badlands token.
                * After damage is dealt (even 0 but not if Ravage is cancelled), any surviving Dahan fight back. Each Dahan inflicts 2 points of damage on Invaders distributed however you wish.
                * Anything that "does not participate in Ravage" does no damage and cannot have damage dealt to it during this phase.
            - name: Build
              text: |
                * Invaders build in each land of the type(s) shown on the card in the Build space, as long as any Invader piece is present there.
                    * If Invaders would build in a land with a Disease token, instead remove 1 Disease token from that land.
                * If the land has more Towns than Cities, add a City, otherwise add a Town.
            - name: Explore
              text: |

                    * If an Invader would explore to a land with a Wilds token, instead remove 1 Wilds token from that land.

    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
        * Game ends in loss immediately if a Spirit loses their last presence disc from the board, you need to draw an Invader card but there are none left, the Blight card or Invader and/or Scenario cards result in a losing condition.
        * Game ends immediately in victory if you satisfy the current victory condition based on the Terror level (Level 1: destroy all Explorers, Towns, and Cities; Level 2: destroy all Towns and Cities; Level 3: Destroy all Cities).

            * One use of a Power
            * A Ravage, Build, or Explore in a single land.
            * Everything 1 Fear Card, Main Event, Token Event, Dahan Event, or Blight Card does. Any effect that applies for "each board/land/player/spirit" is treated as separate actions.
