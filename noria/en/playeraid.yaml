      Each round begins with the start player removing a round marker from the board.  Then, in turn order, each player
      takes a turn consisting of 4 phases: Influence, Action, Politics, Administration.
    sections:
      - name: Influence Phase
        text: |
          Take one or both actions, as many times as you like, paying an increasing cost for each subsequent action.

          In later stages of the game, the base cost for each action increases by 1 knowledge.

          Taking either action a second time doubles the cost.  A third time quadruples it.  Fourth multiplies by 8, etc.

            Total Cost = Base Cost * 2^(n-1)

          ### **Night Shift**
          Rotate the lower or middle ring by one position.

          *Base Cost*: 1 Knowledge.

          ### **Modification**
          Exchange discs in 2 positions.  It can be disc to blank space or swapping discs.

          *Base Cost*: 2 Knowledge

      - name: Action Phase
        text: |
          Activate up to 3 discs, taking a maximum of 4 of the related actions.

          Each ring can only be activated once, but they can be activated in any order

          Each activated disc must be adjacent to the other discs.

          Each activated disc must be in the active (bottom) half of the rings.

          Upgraded disc actions must be completed consecutively.

        sections:
          - name: Bonus Disc
            text: |
              A bonus disc must be activated before any other discs.

              Choose 1 other disc you want to activate this turn and add 1 to its action count.

              An upgraded bonus disc let's you add +1 activations to 2 discs, or +2 activations to 1 disc.

              Applying a bonus to an upgraded disc converts it to a +3 activations.

          - name: Resource Discs
            text: |
              Gather 1 resource per airship of the appropriate type.

              ### **Market**
              Take a disc from the market, paying the appropriate cost.  Place it on center of your wheel, it will not take
              a slot until the Administrative phase

              ### **Investment**
              Move one of your representives higher up a track, paying the appropriate costs. Additionally, pay 1 resource
              for each other players' representative higher than you on that track. Costs can vary between require all the
              same type of a resource, or a mix of the allowed resources.

          - name: Journey Disc
            text: |
              Place your ambassador on 1 island.  You can reveal a new island and place there.  You must move islands
              with each activation of the Journey disc.

              For each ambassador already on that island, pay one resource to the supply.

              Once landed, you may take a ship from the island.  Alternatively, you may place on of your factories on an
              empty slot on the island, taking the corresponding warehouses and placing them next to your tableau.

          - name: Tool Disc
            text: |
              Either upgrade a disc or produce goods.

              ### **Upgrade**

              ### **Production**

              * 1 Complex good for 3 Knowledge
              * 3 Knowledge for 1 basic resource

      - name: Politics Phase (optional)
        text: |
          You may take the *Intrigue* action as many times as you like during this phase.  Each time you take it, the
          base cost is multiplied by the next power of 2.  So the first action is the base cost, the second time that round
          doubles it, the third time quadruples it, the fourth multiplies by 8, x16, x32, etc.

          ### **Intrigue**
          Move 1 politician from the top of any chamber into the leftmost free space of that chamber.  Then, remove
          a politician from the top of any chamger from the game.

          * Base Cost*: Knowledge equal to the number of cog wheels exposed on the round track.

            Total Cost = Base Cost * 2^(n-1)
