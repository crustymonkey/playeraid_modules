          1. Shuffle the *Ocean Characters* deck and place it in the bottom
             row.  Fill the 6 slots with cards from the deck.
              * *(Cold Waters)*: Separate the *Ocean Characters* into 2
                decks based on the ◯ or ◇ symbol in the lower right of the card.
                   * 5 players:  Shuffle both decks together.
                   * 4 players:  Discard 5 random cards from 1 of the decks and
                     shuffle together.
                   * 2 or 3 players:  Discard 10 random cards from 1 deck and
                     shuffle together.
          2. Shuffle the *Locations* deck and place it in the middle row.  Take
             6 cards from the top of the deck to fill the 6 slots.
              * *(Cold Waters)*: Change the *Locations* deck by adding
                the expansion cards and removing some based on player count:
                  * 5 players: Shuffle the expansion deck in.
                  * 4 players: Discard 2 random locations of each type (10
                    total).
                  * 3 players: Discard 4 random locations of each type (20
                    total).
                  * 2 players: Discard 6 random locations of each type (30
                    total).
          3. Place all *Wild Mantas* effect side up next to the board.
          4. Determine a 1st player.
          5. For the basic *King* card distribution, give the 1st player card
             number 1, 2nd player card 2, etc. or you can do the advanced
             setup (below).
          4. You can use the 4 printed goals or do the advanced setup (below).
          5. Advanced Setup:
              1. Shuffle the *Goal* tokens and take 4 at random
                 and place them on the goal spots in any order.
              2. Shuffle as many *King* cards as players + 1 and give them to
                 the last player.  That player takes 1 and passes the rest
                 counter-clockwise.
          6. Each player takes 1 of the player boards.
          7. Each player takes one of the colored symbol mantas and
             corresponding 6 starting character cards.
          8. Each player turns all the Mantas effect side up.
          9. *(Cold Waters)* Tribe Module:
              1. Place the Tribe board on top of the Ocean board so that it
                 covers the Goal Tracks.
              2. Take the Tribe cards and divide them into 2 decks based on
                 their backs (I or II).
              3. Shuffle the decks separately and draw 4 cards from each deck
                 and place them face up in their slots on the tribe board.

          On a turn, players **must** do 1 *Main action* and may also do any
          number of *additional actions*.  These can be done in any order.
      sections:
          - name: Main Action
            text: |
                * During your turn, you **must** play 1 of the character cards
                  from your hand.
                    * If you can perform all of the card's effects, **you must
                      do so**. You may still play the card if you can't use all
                      the effects.
                * After playing the character card, put it in your personal
                  discard pile (right slot above your player board) face up.
          - name: Additional Actions
            text: |
                * **Flipping Mantas**: You can use a ready manta to resolve it
                  and flip it to its used side.
                * **Exploiting Locations' Depths**:
                    * You slide the card up 1 space (left side of the card) to
                      "exploit" it and take the printed reward.
                    * **Resources**: You can only gain resources (coins and
                      power) during your main action.
                    * **Effects**: You can use these before and/or after your
                      main action.
                    * You can only exploit the top depth that is shown on a
                      location card.
                    * Empty depths are blocked until you use a *raise* effect.
          - name: Effects
            text: |
                An effect can be gained by playing a character card, using a
                Manta, or exploiting depths.

                * **Matrona**:
                    * **When playing with 2 players**, you also discard the
                      leftmost character (the free one) from the character
                      row, then refill
                * **Recruit**:
                    1. Choose 1 character from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of coins show below the card and **put
                       it in your hand**.
                    3. Slide the other characters to the left and turn over the
                       top card from the deck to fill the space.
                * **Buy Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the number of coins shown at the top of the card.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Conquer Location**:
                    1. Choose a location from the board.
                    2. Pay the amount of power shown at the top of the card.
                    3. Insert the location in an empty slot of your player
                       board so the top depth is visible in the circle.
                * **Raise Location**:
                    1. Choose a location, or multiple locations (if the effect
                       is more than 1 move), and move it up the number of depths
                       specified by the effect icon.  **You do not get any
                       resources or effects from the depths you covered!**
                    2. When a location is fully risen, you receive the specified
                       wild manta if there is one on the card.  This manta
                       can be used immediately.
                * **Score** (treasure chest): This allows you to move a
                  **fully risen** location and place it in your scoring pile
                  face down.
                * **Scout**:
                    1. Take every location from the top location row and place
                       them in the discard pile.
                    2. Move every location from the bottom row to the top row.
                       If there are more than 4 locations in the bottom row,
                       discard your choice of locations until 4 remain.
                    3. Refill the bottom row with 6 locations.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
          Players take turns until 1 of the 3 game end conditions are met.
          When this happens, everyone (including the player who
          triggered the game end) takes 1 more turn.  Game end
          conditions:

          * 1 player has accomplished all 4 goals (with mantas on
            them).
              * [(Cold Waters)]!blue!: **This is no longer an end game
                trigger if playing with the Tribes module**.
          * The location deck runs out.
          * The character deck runs out.

          Scoring is as follows:

          * 1 point for each character card in your hand, including
                your king, but **not** counting those in your discard
                pile.
          * The number of points shown above your mantas on the
                goals track.
          * The total number of points from locations in your
                scoring pile.  Locations on your player board do **not**
                give you any points.

          Tie breaks:

          1. The player with the most mantas in their reserve.
          2. The player with the lowest number on their king card.
          3. (if not playing with kings) The last player in turn
                 order wins.

          If a player fulfills a goal on their turn, they can place one
          of their (their player color) mantas on the 1st available
          spot for that goal. The manta can be used or unused. **Each
          goal can only be completed once by each player**.

          This module adds Tribe cards of 2 different types:

          * Dark blue cards provide an ongoing bonus (bottom
            of the card).
          * Light blue cards provide an instant bonus (bottom
            of the card).

          You no longer use the Goals and instead will be
          recruiting Tribes to help you.  To get the help of
          a Tribe:

          1. Choose the Tribe to recruit.
          2. Play a Recruit Character action.
          3. Calculate the cost of the Tribe card: Base cost + 1
             coin for each Manta that has already been placed there
             by other players.
          4. Pay for the Tribe. **You can help pay for the card by
             removing Locations from your score pile and returning them
             to the box**.  If you do this, you gain an amount of coins
             equal to the amount of points on the Location card.
          5. Place 1 of your mantas on the chosen Tribe card.
          6. Get the instant bonus as applicable.
