          * Lay out the City board, Deed board, and Score board.  Be sure to
            use the correct side (smaller for 2-3 players, larger for 4-5).
          * Each player picks a color and takes the tray and cubes of their
            color.
          * Score cubes should be placed on their dedicated places on the
            Score board.
          * Pick a start player and give them the Start Player token.
              * The start player takes 5 coins and each other takes 1 more
                than the previous. e.g. the 4th player would take 8 coins.
          * Place the rest of the coins near the board.
          * If playing with less than 5 players, remove some cards:
              * **4 players**: Remove all the red deeds.
              * **3 players**: Remove all the red and purple deeds.
              * **2 players**: Remove all the red, purple, and blue deeds.
          * Shuffle the remaining deeds and deal 6 to each player.
              * **Optional draft variant**: You may draft deed cards instead
                of just using the randomly dealt cards. To do this (after
                the 6 cards have been dealt):
                  1. Each player selects a card from their hand and places it
                     face down.
                  2. After all players have selected a card, everyone
                     simultaneously reveals their cards and places a lot marker
                     on the corresponding location on the City board.
                  3. Each player passes the remaining cards to the person on
                     their left.
                  4. Repeat this until all cards have been drafted.
          * Each player places lot markers corresponding to their deeds.  Then,
            players keep the deed cards in a pile in front of themselves.
          * Split the remaining deed cards in approximately 3 equal piles and
            place them on the 3 eras on the Deed board.
          * Flip over the top 6 cards from Era 1.
          * **If playing with Monuments**:
              * Shuffle all the Monument cards together.
              * Turn over a number of Monuments equal to the number of players
                + 3 and place them near the City board.  Place the matching
                monuments on them.
              * Return the unused monuments and their cards to the box.

          Players do **1** of the following on their turn.

          * **Take Income**: Take 5 silver plus an amount of silver equal
            to the value of any commercial buildings you've built.
          * **Buy a Deed**:
              1. Pay the amount of silver shown above the deed and take the deed
                 card.
              2. Slide the other deeds from right to left fill in the open
                 space.
              3. Fill the last spot with the top card from the current era.
              4. Place one of your lot markers on the matching lot on the
                 city board.
              5. **If the last deed for the current era was purchased, do NOT
                 fill the deeds from the next era yet**.  Instead, proceed to
                 the [End of an Era](#end_era).
          * **Construct a Building**: Build a building from your player supply
            with the following rules:
              * You can build on empty lots you own without restriction.  If
                you are doing this, simply replace the lot markers with a
                building.
              * You can replace an already built building(s) **as long as the
                new building is larger in size**. If that would leave owned
                spaces open, be sure place lot markers in those owned lots.
                **You can never replace a building that is the same size or
                larger**.
              * **If you have constructed a residential building**, move your
                population marker up the the Population tracker equal to the
                amount of citizens on the building you built.
              * *If you are playing with Monuments*:
                  * If you meet the requirement (if any) for the Monument and
                    as well as the above conditions, you may build that
                    Monument.  Place a Monument marker of your color on
                    the newly built Monument.

          When all available deeds for the current Era have been purchased (not
          when the deck runs out), the Era ends.

          * When the deed board is empty, **each player takes one final turn
            to collect income or build**, including the player who purchased
            the last deed.
          * Pass the Start Player token to the player to the left of the
            1 who took the last turn in the previous Era.  They will begin the
            next Era.
          * Perform [end of Era scoring](#end_era_scoring).

                * **Residential Buildings**:
                    * Each player verifies the total number of citizens on
                      constructed buildings matches their position on the
                      Population tracker.
                    * All ties are friendly, so any tied players get the same
                      points/bonuses.
                    * The player with the most citizens scores victory points
                      equal to their position plus the era bonus:
                        * Era 1: 4 points
                        * Era 2: 7 points
                        * Era 3: 10 points
                    * Each other player scores a number of points equal to
                      the number of citizens the next player in front of them
                      has. **You must have at least 1 citizen to gain these
                      points!**
                * **Civic Buildings**:
                    * Players score victory points for symbols on adjacent
                      buildings. **Buildings are only adjacent if they share
                      an edge (orthogonal adjacency)**.
                * **Commercial Buildings**:
                    * Each player takes a number of silver equal to the value
                      of all their constructed buildings. **If it is the
                      final Era, players score victory points instead of
                      collecting silver**.
                    * Each player scores points for any buildings that show
                      a point value on their uncovered spot on their player
                      board.
                * **Monuments**: If playing with Monuments, take the listed
                  silver or points on the Monument card for the monument you
                  built.  These generally score the same as their regular
                  building type.
                * After all players have collected their silver and victory
                  points, refill the Deed board from the next Era and begin
                  the next Era.

          The game ends after the 3rd Era.  In addition to the [End of Era
          Scoring](#end_era_scoring), score the following:

          * **Reminder**: Commercial buildings should receive victory points
            instead of silver at the end of the 3rd Era.
          * Players score 1 victory point for each lot marker they have on
            the City board (marking empty, owned lots).
