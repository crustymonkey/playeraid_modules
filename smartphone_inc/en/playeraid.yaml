          The game consists of 5 rounds and each round has 8 phases.  Phases
          are played in order from left to right.
      sections:
          - name: Phase 1. Planning (Simultaneous)
            text: |
                Players overlap their 2 pads in this phase to set their
                desired actions to take this round.  This should be done in
                secret behind their screens.

                * Pads **must** be parallel or perpendicular to each other.
                * 1 Pad must overlap 1-4 spaces of the other Pad.
                * You may place Improvements on top of the Pad(s).
                * Improvements **must** cover 2 spaces (they can't hang off
                  a Pad).
                * Improvements may overlap other Improvements.
                * A Pad may overlap part of an Improvement.
          - name: Phase 2. Set Prices (Simultaneous)
            id: prices
            text: |
                * All prices should be set to 5 at the beginning of this
                  phase.
                * Each "-$" **reduces** the price by 1 and each "+$" 
                  **increases** the price by 1.
                * **Prices will determine player turn order in future phases**.
                  See the section on [Priority Rule](#pri_rule) for more info.
          - name: Phase 3. Production (Simultaneous)
            id: production
            text: |
                Players produce Goods to sell later. Move Good cubes from the
                supply in their token tray to the available Goods portion.

                1. Move 1 Good for each black Good symbol showing on their pads.
                2. Move 1 Good for each covered cell on their Pads.  **Note that
                   you only count the cells covered by another Pad, and NOT
                   cells covered by Improvements**.
                3. Each yellow Good token produces 1 Good.
                4. Each unused Improvement (face down, not on your Pads)
                   produces 1 Good.
                3. Some researched Technologies or Retailers may also produce
                   additional Goods.
          - name: Phase 4. Improve Production (Priority order)
            text: |
                * If a player has the yellow Improvement symbol active
                  (showing), they take 1 Improvement of their choice from
                  the board.
                * If a player does **not** have the yellow Improvement symbol
                  active, they take a yellow Good token instead.
                * **New Improvements/Goods cannot be used until the NEXT
                  round**.
          - name: Phase 5. Research Technology (Priority order)
            text: |
                1. Players take as many Progress markers as they have
                   purple Progress symbols on their Pads.
                2. On their turn, the player places their Progress markers
                   in the "spinner" space below the patent space of the
                   Tech. they wish to research.
                3. If the number of Progress markers matches the number in the
                   top of the patent space, the player has researched that Tech.
                   and places an Office marker in 1 of the spaces below the
                   Tech.  They should remove their Progress markers.
                    * If the player is the 1st to research the tech, they also
                      take the Patent tile (VP at the end of the game).
                    * **Important**: Taking the Patent tile may mean that other
                      players will also immediately meet the new cost of that
                      Tech. and place their own Office marker.
                4. Each Tech. will grant players who have researched it a bonus
                   of some sort.  They will also allow players to sell to
                   customers seeking that Tech.
                5. Any unused Progress markers are returned to the player's
                   token tray.
          - name: Phase 6. Logistics (Priority order)
            text: |
                1. Players take as many Progress markers as they have blue
                   Logistics symbols showing on their Pads.
                2. On their turn, the player places their Progress markers in
                   the "spinner" space next to the Logistics symbol for a
                   region(s).
                3. If the cost to enter that region (number in the Logistics
                   symbol) has been met, the player removes the Progress tokens
                   and places an Office marker in the left-most space for that
                   region.
                    * **If there are no empty Office spaces for the
                      region, players CANNOT add an Office to that region**.
                    * **Each player may only have 1 Office in a region**.
                4. Any unused Progress markers are returned to the player's
                   token tray.
          - name: Phase 7. Selling Goods (Priority order)
            text: |
                In this phase, players place Goods from their **available
                Goods** they produced during the
                [Production phase](#production).

                * On their turn, the player may sell goods to buyers in
                  **regions where they have an Office** that does **not**
                  contain a Retailer.
                * Each square in the region is a buyer.
                    * To sell to the red (numbered) buyers, the player's price
                      (set in [Phase 2](#prices)) must be <= to the price
                      printed on the buyer.
                    * To sell to the purple (symbols) buyers, the player must
                      have researched the matching Tech.
                * **Any unsold goods are lost** and returned to the supply in
                  the player's tray.
          - name: Phase 8. Receive VP (Simultaneous)
            text: |
                * Each player multiples the number of Goods on the main board
                  by the price set on the board and receive that many VP.
                * *Controlling Regions*:
                    * If a player has the most Goods in a region, they receive
                      bonus VP.
                        * They receive the number of VP specified in the
                          right-most **occupied** Office space (can be any
                          player's Office).
                        * If there are 2 VP numbers for the Office space, the
                          player with the most Goods receives the top number
                          and the player with the 2nd most receives the
                          bottom number.
                        * If there is a tie, it is broken by the player with
                          a good on the furthest left buyer.

            text: |
                * All players return all goods on the board back to their
                  Goods supply area of their tray (**not** in the available
                  Goods portion).
                * Remove any Improvements on the game board and put them
                  back in the box.  Add 5 new Improvements.
                * Reset all prices back to 5.
                * Move the round marker to the next round.

    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
          After 5 rounds, players add VP to their existing total for:

          1. Any VP for Patents they've collected.
          2. Any VP earned from Retailers.

          If there is a tie, the player with the most Tech. researched wins.
          If there is still a tie, the player with the most Patents wins.
          If there is still a tie, tied players share the victory.
    - name: Priority Rule (player turn order)
      id: pri_rule
      text: |
          The "Priority Rule" is used to define turn order during a round after
          prices are set. Similarly, this is also used for tie breaks.
          Priority/turn order is resolved in this order:

          1. The player with the lowest price.
          2. (if tied) Then, the player with the lowest VP count.
          3. (if still tied) Then, the player lower in the order of the starting
             spaces printed on the VP board.

          **Important**: Priority/turn order may change during phases as prices
          may change.
