            * Players simultaneously roll all 3 of their dice.
            * Starting with the 1st player and continuing in player order,
              each player places 1 of their dice on 1 of the action tiles and
              carries out the action.
                * When placing a die on an action tile, you can only place a
                  **die showing a lower value than the lowest value currently
                  showing on the tile**.
                * If you play a blue god, you may ignore this die value
                  restriction.  See [God Cards](#gods) for more info.
            * Continue in this order until all players have placed all of their
              dice.

                * You expand by placing a hut from your player board (any hut)
                  and place in on a building space in an adjacent region.
                    * If there is a hut already in the region, move it off to
                      the side, but keep it in the region.
                    * You may expand via a land path (brown arrow) or water path
                      (blue arrow) based on the action taken (this is only a
                      separate action with 4 players).
                    * The number on your die indicates the **highest** value
                      land/water path you can take.
                    * You may **not** expand diagonally.
                    * **You may never have more than 1 of your huts in a
                      region**.
                * Take either the matching building material as depicted on the
                  new region (and add it to your ceremony space) or an offering
                  tile.
                * You must decide **now and only now** whether or not to
                  score the VP for the fish tile adjacent to the new region.
                    * To score the fish tile, you must play a red god card.
                      See [God Cards](#gods) for more information on using god
                      cards.
                    * Fish tiles can only be scored once per player per region
                      and **only** during expansion.

                The action is the same for woman or man tiles. "Woman" is
                used here to represent either.

                * Take 1 woman tile from any position <= to the die value
                  you used to take the action.
                * Place the tile onto a free space (no hut or other tile)
                  on the right hand side of your player board such that
                  the tile covers the green check mark at the top of the
                  space, but leaves the bottom symbols visible.
                    * If you don't have a free space (no hut or other tile),
                      you cannot take this action.

                * Your die results dictate how many items you can trade for.
                    * The trade costs are in the top left of your board:
                        * 1 die point: tattooing, shell collecting, or
                          scoring 1 VP
                        * 2 die points: an offering, god card, building
                          material, or move a hut

                * **Tattooing**: for each die point, shift 1 (not yet)
                  tattooed man tile on your player board down so the green
                  check mark shows.
                    * Move your status marker 1 space to the right for each
                      status symbol on the left side of the man tile.
                        * If you land on an occupied space, place your disc on
                          top of the stack.
                * **Collecting shells**: (similar to tattooing) shift the
                  woman tile down and collect the number of shells showing
                  on the left side of the tile.
                * **VP**: for each die point spent, get 1 VP.
                * **Offerings**: for every 2 die points spent, collect an
                  offering.
                * **God cards**: for every 2 die points spent, add 1 god card
                  to your hand.  If you take a face up card, immediately replace
                  it.
                * **Building materials**: for ever 2 die points spent,
                  take 1 building material of your choice and place it on a
                  matching ceremony space.
                * **Move hut**: for every 2 die points spent, move 1 of
                  your huts to the last (12th) space on your player board.
                    * Huts already on the main board cannot be moved.

                * Add 1 of your priests to the temple on the main board.
                    * The die indicates the highest value space you can
                      place your priest.
                    * If there is already a priest there, shift him 1 space
                      in the direction of the arrows.
                        * This can cause a chain reaction of shifting priests.
                        * If a priest shifts off the end, return it to its
                          owner.

                * Score 2 victory points for any die placed on the fishing
                  action in the upper left part of the main board.

            In turn order, players may use 1 of their man tiles **and** 1 of
            their woman tiles.  The order is up to the player.

              them for a more powerful man or woman single action.
                * The location of the tiles on your player board does not
                  matter.
                * Using them does not change them in any way.

        * To play a god card, you **must** spend an offering.
        * Place used god cards in a discard pile next to the draw pile.
            * If you run out of god cards, shuffle the discard to make a new
              draw pile.
        * You may spend 2 matching god cards as any other god card (wild).
            * You still only spend 1 offering (not 2).

        * **Blue god** ([phase A](#phase_a)): This allows you to add a die to
          an action tile and ignore the ["lower than" restriction](#phase_a)
          (you may play any die value to the action space).
        * **White god** ([phase A](#phase_a)): When you play a white god, the
          die you place on an action tile is considered to be a 6. However,
          do **not** change the value of the die.
        * **Red god** (phase [A](#phase_a) or [B](#phase_b)): When
          [expanding into a new region[(#expand), you can spend this to
          score the fish tile.
            * Score the depicted number of points.
            * Do not remove the fish tile.
        * **Green god** ([phase B](#phase_b)): When playing this god, do 1 of
          the following:
            * Double the effect of the [man or woman](#woman) type you are
              currently using.
                * If you are using multiple identical tiles, double the *total*
                  amount (after accounting for the effect of multiple tiles).
            * *OR* Activate a 2nd, different, man or woman type.
        * **Yellow god** ([phase C](#phase_c)): Place this to replace exactly
          1 of a task tile's requirements. e.g. if a task requires 3 wood, you
          could spend this god to make that requirement 2 wood.
