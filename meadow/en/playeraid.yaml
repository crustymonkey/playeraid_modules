          1. Place the game board.
          2. Place the road tokens near the board.
          3. Shuffle the N, S, W, E decks separately.
          4. Place the W, S, E decks in their holders and place these on the
             board in their correct spot.
          5. Place the N deck off the board near the other decks.
          6. Fill the board with cards from their corresponding decks (W on
             the left, E on the right, and S in the 2 middle columns).
          7. Place the campfire corresponding to the player count near the
             main board.
          8. Shuffle the goal tokens and randomly place them on the square
             spots on the campfire board. Return unused tokens to the box.
          9. **When playing with 2 or 3 players**, block notches of the campfire
             board with block tokens. Block 2 in a 2 player game and 1 in a 3
             player game.
          9. Each player chooses a color and takes:
              * 5 path tokens, or **4 in a 4 player game** (return the "?"
                token)
              * 3 bonus tokens
              * 1 road token with the visible road symbol
              * 1 2-sided starting ground card
          10. Place the round marker on the 1st rock of the round tracker.
          11. Determine a start player.
          11. Players now take starting cards:
              * Beginning with the player to the right of the start player and
                proceeding in counter-clockwise order:
                  1. A player selects a **row** of 4 cards and takes it plus
                     the top card from the N deck as their starting hand.
                  2. The row of cards are refilled from their respective decks.
                  3. Repeat until each player has a starting hand of 5 cards.
              * Optionally, you can deal 5 cards to each player randomly such
                that each player ends up with:
                  * 2 S cards
                  * 1 each of N, E, and W cards
          12. Each player then creates a play area with their starting ground
              and road token.
          13. Each player then places 1 of their cards to the left or right
              of their starting ground.

          ### Components by Player Count

          The game is played over the course of 6 or 8 rounds, with players
          taking turns in clockwise order starting with the 1st player.

          Players will take actions using their path tokens by slotting them
          into a notch on the main board or the campfire board.

                * Place your path token in one of the notches in the main
                  board.
                    1. You then **must** take the card N spaces away from the
                       token, where N is the number printed on the top half
                       of the token.
                        * If you've played the "?" token, you may
                          take any card in the row.
                    2. Refill the slot where the card was taken with the top
                       card of the corresponding deck.
                        * If the corresponding deck is empty, leave the slot
                          empty. Any further tokens placed referencing this
                          empty location can **only** play a card from their
                          hand (#3).
                    3. You may then play 1 card from your hand into your play
                       area (including the card you just picked up). See [card
                       rules](#card_rules) for more info on how to play cards.

                * You may slot your path token into 1 of the available square
                  slots on the edge of the board and take the special action
                  as shown on the bottom half of the path token (see the
                  table below for actions). The "?" action allows you to take
                  any of the 4 actions. **OR**
                    * If you qualify, you may place your **lowest numbered**
                      bonus token in between 2 of the goal tiles on the
                      campfire board.
                        * You must have both symbols in your meadow/surrounding
                          area.
                        * This can be placed, before, during, or after the
                          action on the path token (whenever you meet the
                          requirements, which could involve playing cards).
                * You may place a path token on any of the open benches and
                  take the action, which is playing 1 card.
                    * **Note**: You may **not** place a bonus token if you
                      are taking this action

                | Symbol | Action |
                | ------ | ------ |
                | ![take card](/static/img/meadow/take_card.png) | Take any face up card from the main board and refill the spot from the corresponding deck. You cannot play this card this round. |
                | ![road tokens](/static/img/meadow/road_tokens.png) | Take 2 road tokens and place them in your "surrounding area" with the road symbol face up. |
                | ![top 3 cards](/static/img/meadow/3_cards.png) | Look at the top 3 cards of 1 deck **on the board**. Add 1 to your hand and discard the other 2 to the bottom of the corresponding deck. |
                | ![play 2](/static/img/meadow/play_2.png) | Play up to 2 cards from your hand. |

                The round ends when all players have placed all their path
                tokens. Then:

                * Players retrieve their path tokens.
                * Path the 1st player token to the person on the 1st player's
                  left.
                * Move the round marker 1 space. If you have passed the
                  hourglass symbol, perform the actions below for the
                  "Halfway Point".

                ## Halfway Point
                When the hourglass symbol is passed, do the following:

                1. Discard all of the cards from the main board and randomly
                   place them on the bottom of their corresponding decks.
                2. Replace the S deck with the N deck.
                3. Refill the board with new cards from the corresponding
                   decks.

          Players count the following victory points and the player with
          the most points wins.

          * The points on the cards in your meadow/surrounding area.
          * The points from the bonus tokens on the campfire board. The number
            on the token is the number of points it is worth.

          If there is a tie:

          1. The player with the most discovery cards played wins.
          2. (if still tied) The players share the victory.

                * Observation cards can be played on top of ground cards or
                  other observation cards.
                * You may have any number of observation cards in a column.
                * You must meet the requirements shown on the card by having
                  the symbols somewhere in your meadow.
                    * **Card has 1 requirement**: This card must be played on
                      top of a card with the required symbol.
                    * **Card has 2+ requirements**: You can play this card
                      on top of any card with 1 of the required symbols.
                        * **All symbols must be visible in your meadow to play
                          this card**.
                        * If 1 of the requirements is a [ground
                          symbol](#ground), you can play it directly on top
                          of said ground card or on top of another observation
                          card at the top of the column (regardless of the
                          symbols on the card at the top).
                * If requirements have a slash (/) in between them, you
                  only need to meet 1 of the 2 requirements. You decide.
                * If a requirement has left/right "arrows" (<>), the card
                  must be played in a column where the requirement is met
                  in an adjactent column.
                    * If this requirement is accompanied by another requirement
                      without arrows, you can then choose where to place it.
                      Either fulfilling the adjacency **or** putting it on
                      top of the symbol without the arrows.
                * **You can always discard 2 cards to ignore 1 missing
                  symbol**.  This can be done multiple times.
                    * Cards are discarded to the bottom of their corresponding

                      road symbol is **not** visible.
                    * **Card requires a road token + other symbols**: You must
                      have the required symbols in your meadow and 1 unused
                      road token. If so, place it as in the previous bullet.

                      showing.
                    * **Card requires a landscape + other symbols**: You must
                      have an unused landscape and all of the required symbols
                      in your meadow. If so, place it as in the previous bullet.
