      * Place the main board and add expansion boards based on player count:
          * **1-3 players**: Use only the main board.
          * **4 players**: Add the 4th player expansion board.
          * **5 players**: Add the 4th and 5th player expansion boards.
      * Shuffle and add all the building tiles matching the available spaces
        on the main/expanion boards.
      * Reveal the top building tile from each stack.
      * Place the 1st and 2nd player turn order pedestals on the board.
      * Each player chooses a color and:
          * Takes their resource board (all players use the same side, either
            A or B)
          * Takes their player marker
      * Place the player markers on the turn order track in random order.
      * Place long road tiles and sets of short road tiles (sets are two 2x1
        tiles and one 1x1 tile) below the main board based on player count:
          * **1-2 players**: 1 long road and 1 set of short roads.
          * **3 players**: 2 long roads and 1 set of short roads.
          * **4 players**: 2 long roads and 2 sets of short roads.
          * **5 players**: 3 long roads and 2 sets of short roads.
      * Place 1 tower alongside the road tiles.  Set the others aside for
        later use.
      * Shuffle the monument cards, reveal 3, and place their respective
        monuments on each one. Set the rest of the deck nearby.
      * If playing with the [advanced rules](#advanced), shuffle the public
        objectives and randomly place 3 cards face up near the board.  The
        rest of the deck can be returned to the box.
      * Create a supply of loan tiles.
      * Each player takes a map board. All players must use the same side,
        either A or B.
      * Give each player:
          * 1 long road tile
              * **This tile is placed during your 1st turn of the game at
                no cost along with any piece(s) purchased during that turn**.
          * 1 gold marker (set to 0)
          * 1 population marker (set to 0)
          * 3 resource markers (set to 0)
  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over the course of up to 10 rounds (shown by the
      number of tiles in each building stack) **or** when a player reaches
      the end of the population track (play to the end of the round).

      The round ends when all players have spent all their gold.
    sections:
      - name: Actions
        text: |
          * Each player takes turns taking 1 action (below) on their turn.
          * In addition to the action taken, a player can take a loan (gain 2
            gold) or pay off a loan (pay 3 gold) as a free action.
              * **Players may only have 1 loan at any time**.
              * Loans are worth -2 points if not payed back by the end of
                the game.

          ## Actions
          Actions consist of purchasing items and, generally, immediately
          placing them in their city. **Tiles cannot be saved for later
          turns**.

          * 1 long road tile: 1 gold
          * 1 set of short road tiles (two 2x1 + one 1x1): 1 gold
          * 1 building tile: Pay the cost shown on the stack/back of the tile
          * The tower: 2 gold (**do not replace the tower until the [end
            of the round](#endround)**)
              * Increase your city's resource markers based on the matching
                symbols on the tile.
                  * If you land on/pass a population symbol, move your
                    population marker up 1 space.
          * The 1st or 2nd player turn order pedestal: 1 gold
          * 1 monument: Spend **all** of your remaining gold
              * When purchased, replace the monument with a new one from the
                top of the deck.
              * All placement requirements must be met in order to purchase
                a monument.
              * If the monument has a resource reward, move up on the
                matching track.
                  * If you land on/pass a population symbol, move your
                    population marker up 1 space.
      - name: Tile Placement Rules
        text: |
          **Important**: Natural resources spaces are considered land spaces.
          It is possible to score points for these spaces at the [end of
          the game](#endgame) if they are not covered.

          * Road tiles must always be placed orthogonally adjacent to:
              * Other road tiles
              * The "sidewalk" along the bottom of their map board
              * A tower
          * A tower must:
              * Be orthogonally adjacent to anything placed on the map.
              * Be placed on a land space (not water).
          * Building tiles must:
              * Be placed on land spaces (not water).
              * Be orthogonally adjacent to a road tile **OR**
              * Be orthogonally adjacent to another building tile of the same
                color.
          * Monuments all have their own placement rules.

          ## Monument Symbols

          | Symbol | Description |
          | ------ | ----------- |
          | ![sidewalk](/static/img/world_wonders/sidewalk.png) | Adjacent to the sidewalk (bottom of the city board) |
          | ![b_type](/static/img/world_wonders/b_types.png) | Adjacent to a building type |
          | ![nat_res](/static/img/world_wonders/nat_res.png) | Adjacent to a natural resource |

          Do the following at the end of the round:

          1. If the 10th round was completed or a player has reached the
             end of their population track, proceed to [final
             scoring](#endgame).
          1. Discard all building tiles not purchased during the round.
          2. Reveal a new building tile of each type.
          3. Replace all purchased road tiles.
          4. Replace the tower (if purchased).
          5. Rearrange the player markers according to the turn order.
              1. If someone purchased the 1st/2nd pedestals, they take
                 the 1st 2 spots.
              2. Arrange the remaining players in order according to their
                 population (lowest 1st to highest last).
                  1. If tied, arrange players according to number of monuments
                     (least 1st to highest last).
                  2. If still tied, arrange players relatively according to
                     the turn order from the previous round.
          6. Everyone sets their gold marker back to 7.

      The game ends when either the 10th round is completed (noted by building
      stacks) or someone reaches the final space of the population track
      (play to the end of the round).

      Flip the building board to its back side and score.

      ## Scoring

      * 1 VP for each ring your population marker reached or passed.
      * Points equal to your least produced resource.
          * e.g. if your food, ceramics, and gear markers are at 8, 9, and 11,
            you earn 8 points.
      * 1 VP for each ring on your monuments.
      * 1 VP for every **visible** natural resource that is orthogonally
        adjacent to at least 1 piece placed on your map.
      * 1 VP for each building tile that is surrounded on all sides by any
        feature other than plain green spaces.
          * All sides must be adjacent to other building tiles, road tiles,
            monuments, towers, natural resources, water spaces, the sidewalk,
            or an edge of the map.
      * -2 VP if you have an unpaid loan.
      * If playing the [advanced](#advanced) game, players score points based
        on who did the best towards each objective.
          * If tied for 1st place, add the points together and divide them
            among tied players, rounding **up**.
          * If players are tied for 2nd place, each tied player gets 1 VP.

      The player with the most points wins.  If tied, the player with the most
      monuments wins.
