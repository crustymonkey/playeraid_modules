                      * This is **not** a heroic action, so you do not gain

              * An event, battle card, dungeon room, etc. makes you lose
                resources/items that you do not have (gain 1 corruption, see
                also [spending vs. losing](#spending)).
              * *Alliances*: Similar to the above, if you cannot fully resolve
                a power skull effect, gain a corruption.
          * If you would gain a 3rd corruption, the game ends immediately as
            a loss.
          * You cannot gain more than 1 corruption per event, battle card,
            or dungeon room.
          * Removed corruptions go to the bottom of the corruption deck.

          * Each kingdom has 1 of each of the 4 types of buildings.
          * When skulls come out of the tower, they must be placed on
            buildings, but the kingdom's owner decides where to place
            the skulls.
              * If skulls drop into a dormant kingdom (no owner), the current
                player decides where to place the skull(s).
          * If a 4th skull would be placed on a building:
              * The building is destroyed and both the building and
                the 3 skulls on it + the 4th that would be placed are
                removed **from the game**.
              * The owner of the kingdom gains a corruption.
              * It it was a dormant kingdom (no owner), no one gains a
                corruption.
          * If you ever need to take a skull from the supply and there are
            none, the players immediately lose the game.

          * The app will tell you how many power skulls of each type to use.
          * The supply of power skulls is kept in the bag with standard
            skulls.
          * When you enter a space with a power skull by any means, resolve
            the skull effect (below).
              * If you cannot fully resolve the skull effect, gain
                a corruption.
              * If there are multiple power skulls in the space, resolve
                each skull's effect, 1 at a time in your choice of order.
                  * It's possible to gain multiple corruptions in this case.
          * If a power skull is placed onto a space with a hero, do **not**
            resolve its effect.

          * Each guild has a rank (1-4) represented by the guild marker on it.
              * You can increase the guild's rank by performing a Reinforce
                action at the corresponding guild hall.
                  * Note that you do **not** gain the building's normal
                    reinforce effect.
                  * As with a normal reinforce action, you may roll the haggle
                    die.
              * If the rank would ever increase beyond 4, it stays at 4, but
                every hero in the guild's kingdom gains 2 spirit.
              * If the guild's rank would ever decrease below 1, it stays
                at 1, but every here in the guild's kingdom loses 2 spirit.
                  * Gain a corruption if you cannot lose 2 spirit.
          * If a guild hall is destroyed, discard all remaining companions
            and set the rank to 1. The rank can never be increased again.
          * Each guild has an ongoing effect (positive or negative, depending
            on the rank) that applies to heroes while they are in the
            guild's kingdom.
          * If a guild's rank is increased and there is a companion in the
            slot, recruit them immediately. Update the app via the guild
            companion button.
          * There is a monthly guild quest that works like other
            [quests](#quest), but if not completed, will usually result
            in a penalty.

          * For information on building monuments, see the [build

          * A completed monument counts as the building it replaces.
          * Each monument can hold up to 3 skulls.
              * If it would receive a 4th skull, it is destroyed (like a
                normal building). See [Skulls and Buildings](#skulls) for
                this process. In addition, note in the app that it was
                destroyed.
          * Each completed monument has the free reinforce effect of the
            building it replaces.
          * Each completed monument has a new enhanced reinforce effect, which
            **replaces** the normal enhanced effect. See the monument card
            for this new effect.
          * Reinforcing at a monument counts as a normal reinforce action.
          * Completed monuments will generate beneficial events.
          * Once a monument has been completed, that kingdom
            will no longer gain [wasteland](#wasteland) tokens.

        text: |
          * The app will tell you where and when to place these.
          * A space with a wasteland token loses its terrain type. They can
            never gain a terrain type from other effects either.
          * When a hero enters a space with a wasteland token, they may not
            leave the space for the remainder of the turn. This includes
            regular movement, but also special effects.
          * Wasteland tokens can only be removed by specific effects that
            expressly remove them.
          * Once a [monument](#monuments) has been completed, that kingdom
            will no longer gain wasteland tokens.

          * These are used in addition to skulls from the base game (not
            replacing them).
          * "Creeping Doom" events will instruct you to place doom skulls in
            the tower.
          * Place doom skulls in the same fashion that you would place normal
            skulls when they come out of the tower.
          * Doom skull may **not** be removed, cleansed, moved, or returned
            to the supply by any effect.
              * They are only removed from the game when the [building is

          * Doom skulls count as regular skulls for all negative effects.
      - name: Wands (Covenant)

          * These are a new type of treasure that uses charge tokens.
          * Note that an acquired wand will start with a certain number of
            charge tokens (indicated on the card).
          * You can spend charge tokens to use a wand.
          * The card indicates how you can gain additional charges.
          * There is no limit to the number of charge tokens on a wand.
          * Charge tokens are considered to be unlimited.

          * **At the end of your turn, lose any blessings you have not spent**.
            You cannot keep them between turns.
          * Blessings cannot be traded.
          * When spent/lost, they are returned to the supply.

          * If your quarry token is on a foe during your banner action, you
            may move that foe up to 2 spaces (instead of placing the token).
          * You cannot move the quarry token to another foe until the foe is

          * Also take 6 spell cards and 4 invocation cards during setup.
              * Start the game with the spell cards in hand, but not the
                invocation cards (set them aside).
          * During setup, also create a supply of protection tokens near your
            hero board.
          * Prepare a number of spells at the start of each month equal to
            the month number (2 spells at the start of month 2).
              * This is done after the monthly quests are revealed, but before
                the 1st player takes their turn.
          * To prepare a spell, place a spell from your hand near your hero
            board. Set aside any unprepared spells.
          * You may cast each prepared spell once during the month it was
            prepared.

          * **Aura of Friendship**: You can use the reinforce effect of any
            building on the board when you take the reinforce action. Pay
            any cost as normal.  This effect includes completed
            [monuments](#monuments).
          * **Bounty of the Gods**: Shuffle the quest item cards and look at
            3 at random, choose 1 to gain, and return the other 2 to the deck.
            At the end of the turn, return the chosen item to the deck
            if it has not already been returned (and even if another player
            now has it).
          * **Ritual of Warding**: Place a protection token on your space.
            The next time a wasteland or foe would spawn on that space,
            the protection token blocks it. Remove the protection token after
            a block occurs (back to the supply). Also indicate in the app if
            a foe is blocked. It does **not** prevent the Adversary from
            spawning.
          * **Smite the Wicked**: Remove a savage or lethal foe from anywhere
            on the board. Update the app to indicate this foe being removed.
          * **Soothing Word**: 1 hero on your space puts 1 of their
            corruption on the bottom of the corruption deck and draws a new
            1 to replace it.  Note that this does **not** count as gaining
            a corruption.
      - name: Monuments (Covenant)

          * **Arch of the Golden Sun**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you end your turn with 2
                or more foes on/adjacent to your hero. Foes do not have to
                be on the same space.
          * **Argent Oak**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you gain a corruption
                through a game effect. You cannot just take a corruption
                to advance this.
              * **Reinforce**: You may spend any number of items to remove
                an equal number of corruptions from your hero.
          * **Cenotaph of the First Prophet**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you defeat a foe in
                a wasteland space with the Battle action. Removing a foe via
                some other effect does not trigger this.
              * **Reinforce**: Choose a virtue tile for any hero not in the
                game and place it active side up on your player board,
                replacing 1 of the inactive virtues (remove it from the game).
          * **Colossus of Björn**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you lose 8 or more
                warriors in a battle.  You **must** remove at least 8 warriors
                in total, so if an effect reduces the number, you have not
                met the condition.
              * **Reinforce**: You must place yourself and the monument on the
                same space. Any skulls on the monument move with it.
          * **Endless Necropolis**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you spend or lose a
                treasure. This must be spent/lost via a game effect. You
                cannot simply discard a treasure.
              * **Reinforce**: Return any number of skulls to the supply.
                You do **not** gain spirit for this as it is not a cleanse
                action. You cannot remove doom skulls.
              * **Special Effect**: This monument can hold any number of
                skulls, but you cannot cleanse to remove skulls on this
                monument.
          * **Moonstone Temple**
              * **Reinforce**: You may battle and cleanse any number of times
                on the turn you pay the cost. After each of these [heroic
                actions](#heroic), gain 2 spirit as normal.
          * **Nightmare Cage**
              * **Reinforce**: Remove a foe. Update the app for the foe you
                removed.
          * **Tower Shard**
              * **Offering**: Place an offering when you defeat a foe
                adjacent to the tower with a battle action. Removing a foe
                by other means does not trigger this.
