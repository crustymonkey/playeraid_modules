            tiles with 3+ and 4 on the back to the box.
          * **If playing with the promo musicians**, mix the promo musicians

    text: |
      The game is played in continuous turns until someone gains the 3rd of the
      5 stars.  Play continues until everyone has had equal turns.

      * On your turn, you are going to place a worker at one of the locations
        and take it's action with the following rules:
          * If you place your worker on a space with another worker that worker
            is "kicked out".  The player who owns the kicked worker places
            it on any **open** kick out space for that location.  They may
            immediately gain the bonus of that kick out space.
          * If all your workers are on the board, take a worker already on the
            board and place it on a **different** space.
              * **You can never place your worker on the same location you just
                removed it from**, whether it's the action space or a kick out
                space.
              * **You can never place your worker on a location that already has
                one of your workers on it**, whether it's on the action space or
                a kick out space.
          * **If you are playing with the 2 player variant**:
              * You may leave an assistant on an **action space** (not a kick
                out space) that you are vacating with one of your workers.
                  * This assistant can come from your supply or somewhere else
                    on the board.
              * Similar to placing a worker on a space occupied by another
                worker, if there is an assistant, it is kicked out and placed
                on a kick out space similar to a worker.
              * **If you kick out your own assistant**, either remove it from
                the board or move it to the space you took that worker from.
                It does **not** go to a kick out space.
              * You can have 1 of your workers and multiple assistants in the same
                location.
              * If a kick out occurs when no spaces are available, the player
                doing the kicking removes one of their assistants from a kick
                out space.  If they don't have any of their assistants there,
                they choose an opponents assistant and return it to the
                player's supply.
                  * Workers on kick out spaces **cannot** be replaced by
                    assistants.

          * Choose up to 1 tile from the tiles on the left and up to 1 tile
            from the tiles on right.
              * If the tile does not have a die on it, place a 1 value die
                on it.
              * The cost to hire a musician is the cost printed on the board
                above its type **plus** the cost for its fame level (also
                printed in the upper left of your player board):
                  * 1 fame: 1 money
                  * 2 fame: 3 money
                  * 3 fame: 6 money
                  * 4 fame: 10 money
                  * 5 fame: 15 money
                  * 6 fame: **cannot be hired**
          * Once hired, place the musician in the matching space on your player
            board and take the note tile pictured in the lower left of that
            tile. Place the note tile in its place on your player board.
          * You may only have 1 musician of each type.  You **cannot** hire
            a musician of a type you already have!
          * Note that if you are playing with the promo musician tiles, they
            start out with more than 1 fame. They also have benefits
            that are not instant note tiles.
              * João: When you close your restaurant, remove an additional cube
                from the prestige track if you have a critic in your
                restaurant.
                  * You can use this the same turn that you dismiss this
                    musician.
              * Vital: When you close your restaurant, you can use up to 2
                additional customers to upgrade your musicians' fame.  e.g. if
                you have 2 customers in your restaurant, you can spend as if
                you had 4, with 2 of them being a color of your choice.
              * Marina: When you hire/contract Marina, immediately gain 2 money.
                  * Note that you must pay the cost for Marina **before**
                    gaining the money.

          ## Close your restaurant
          1. For each customer at a table, you receive an amount of money as
             shown above your prestige track.  e.g. if you have removed 3

              * Customers can only be used once to increase the fame of a
                musician.

                  * Place them in the matching "star musician" space of the
                    board and gain the star below the space.
                  * Score 6 points.

             keep them or dismiss them.
              * If you want to keep them, simply leave them in your restaurant.
              * If you decide to dismiss them:
                  * Return the tile to its appropriate area of the musician
                    market.
                  * Score points equal to their fame.
          5. If you have a critic in your restaurant, remove the 2 leftmost
             cubes from your prestige track (from the game) and return the
             critic to 1 of the customer groups without a critic.
          6. Remove all customers and place them in the customer discard pile.

          ## Prestige track
          The following occurs as cubes are removed from the prestige track.

            customer at a table increases.
          * After the 5th is removed, remove the decoration tile and unlock
            your 4 seat table.
          * After the last cube is removed and you are the 1st to do so, gain
            the star from the board next to the table in the lower right of

      ## Final Scoring
      * Each musician in your restaurant scores points equal to its fame
        value.

            highest value of points and so forth for 2nd/3rd.
              * If you do not have cubes next to the musician, you do not score
                any points.
              * If there is a tie, sum the positions and divide the number by
                the number of tied players, rounded down.  Award that many
                points to those tied players.
      * Each player scores points based on the number of scored fado tiles
        on their board.
          * 1 tile: 3 points
          * 2 tiles: 6 points
          * 3 tiles: 10 points
          * 4+ tiles: 15 points
      * 1 point for every 5 money

      The player with the most points wins.  If there is a tie, the player
      with the most stars wins.  If still tied, the player who scored the
      most fado tiles wins.  If still tied, the player with the most money
