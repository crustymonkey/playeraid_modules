      The game is played over a series of turns until either a player
      completes their 6th heist or when any car (player or police) enters
      the red zone at the end of the road.  After that turn is completed,
      there is [1 special final turn](#end_game) before [final
      scoring](#end_game).

              * If the boss does not like the results, they may $1 to re-roll
                **any number** of dice. This can be repeated multiple times.

                a new deck.
          * This phase may be performed simultaneously unless there is a timing
            conflict, in which case they should be resolved in clockwise order
            starting with the boss.

            sum of each pair of dice
              * If both pairs are the same value, the boss activates the same
                gang member **twice**.

            of dice.

             the police die (black die).
              * The police car never takes shortcuts.
          2. In turn order, each player with fewer than 2 active heists takes
             new heists from the display until they have 2 active.
              * The heist display is immediately replenished when there are
                fewer than 5 heists showing (the 5th being the top of the
                deck).
              * If there are not enough heists in the display/deck for each
                player to have 2 active heists, each player that completed
                heists this turn takes only **1** heist.
          3. Check for [game end](#end_game) conditions:
              * 1 player has completed 6 or more heists.
              * **or** any car (player or police) has entered the red zone at
                the end of the road.
              * If the end game is triggered, the next turn is the [final
                turn as outlined in the end game section](#end_game).
          4. If the end game is not triggered, pass all the dice to the next
             player (clockwise) and that player becomes the new boss. Proceed
             back to [phase 1](#roll).
  - name: End of the Game and Scoring
    id: end_game
    text: |
      The game ends when either a player completes their 6th heist or when
      a car (player or police) enters the red zone at the end of the road.
      Note that the final turn has special rules.

      ### The Final Turn
      * No dice can be rolled.
      * Each player uses the 4 golden dice to form 2 pairs, independently of
        each other.
      * Each player activates 2 gang members based on the die pairs they've
        picked.
      * This final turn ends after phase 2.

      ### Scoring
      * Points on completed heists.
      * Points from *final scoring* effects on completed heists.
      * Points on collected loot cards.
      * Visible points on upgrade cards.
      * 2 points for each necklace.
      * 1 point for every 2 markers on active heists/tasks/storage, rounded
        down.
      * **Lose** 3 points if your car is *behind* the police car (no points are
        lost if you are on the same space as the police car).

      The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the player with
      the highest remaining value in coins wins.  If there is still a tie,
      the players share the victory.
