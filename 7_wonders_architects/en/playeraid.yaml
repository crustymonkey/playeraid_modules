      completes their wonder, after which the game immediately ends.

        right, left, or the central face down deck and placing it in your
        tableau.

          * If you ever have the resources to construct a wonder stage, you
            **must** construct it. This includes the use of available [yellow
            cards](#yellow).

          ## Wonder Construction
          * You must construct your wonder top to bottom.  All stages of a
            level must be completed before building anything on the next
            level.
          * Some wonders give you an option for what to build at a level.
          * [Yellow cards](#yellow) (coins) are wild resources that can/must
            be used as any resource to build your wonder.
          * Resource requirements:
              * "2â‰ ": 2 **different** resources are required
              * "2=": 2 **identical** resources are required

                your turn.
                  * **Note that the cat cannot be used for any additional
                    card draws you may get on your turn**.  It can only be

                in the face down stack.
              * If a face up token is taken, immediately replace it.

        text: |
          * These cards provide shields that are used in military conflicts.
          * If you take a card with horn symbols, flip over the matching
            number of conflict tokens to their red side.  e.g. if you take
            a red card with 2 horns, flip over 2 conflict tokens.
          * When you flip the last conflict token to it's red side, a battle
            occurs at the end of your turn.

          ## Battle
          1. Each player counts the number of shields on cards, wonders, etc.
             that they have.
          2. Each player compares the number of shields with their neighbors
             and if they have more than a neighbor, they take 1 military
             victory token (3 points).
              * If players are tied, no one takes a token.
          3. All players discard any cards with a horn icon. Red cards
             without horns are kept in front of players.
          4. Flip all conflict tokens to their white side.

          * The 1st player on either side of medal to achieve the objective
            takes the medal and scores 4 points at the end of the game.
          * If playing with the **Expert Variant**, the 1st player to achieve
            either of the medals in the center area can claim them.
          * The number of elements for an objective is a minimum.  You can have
