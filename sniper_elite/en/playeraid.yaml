          1. Choose a map to play on and place it on the table.
          2. **Sniper Setup**:
              * Take the matching dry erase map board.
              * Shuffle the objective cards for the chosen map and draw 2.
                If they are the same suit, return 1 (your choice) to the
                bottom of the deck and draw a new one.  Repeat this until
                you have 2 objectives in different suits.
              * Place 6 aim, 2 noise, and 3 recoil tokens in the shot bag.
                Place the remaining aim and noise tokens near the board and
                return the remaining recoil tokens to the box.
              * Choose any 3 loadout cards.  Shuffle the rest and place them
                face down near the board.
          3. **Defender Setup** (after the sniper setup):
              * Place the defender minis on their starting spaces. Officers
                go on the spaces with the iron cross.
              * Choose any 3 specialists (1 for each set of colored squads)
                and place them face up.
                  * Put 2 cubes of the color matching the squad on each card.
                  * Put 1 suppression token on each card.
                  * If the "Kennel Master" is chosen, that player also takes
                    the 2 dog tokens.
              * Put the remaining colored cubes on the "10" space of the
                countdown track.

          The sniper takes the 1st turn, followed by the defenders with
          each squad taking their turn. This constitutes a round.

                The sniper's goal is to complete their 2 objectives before
                time runs out on the countdown track or they are killed.

                At the start of the game, mark 1 of the 4 starting locations
                (arrows) as your entry point. **It must not be in the same
                colored zone as either of your objectives**.

                If your mini is on the board at the start of your turn,
                remove it.

                Your turn consists of 3 things you can do in any order:

                * Move
                * Use **1** loadout card
                * Take **1** additional action
                    * Shooting
                    * Looting
                    * Completing an objective

                You can do any/all/none of these on your turn.

                - name: Movement
                  text: |
                      * You can move 0-3 spaces.
                      * If you move 0 or 1 spaces, you remain hidden.
                      * If you move 2 or 3 spaces, you must tell your opponents
                        exactly which enemies heard noise.
                          * They will hear noise if you passed through a
                            space adjacent to an enemy unit.
                          * **This includes your starting and ending spaces**.
                          * Note that defenders **can** hear you through walls,
                            obstructions or other elevations.
                      * You cannot enter a space that contains a defending
                        unit. If a defender moves into your space, you do
                        **not** disclose this to the defender.
                      * You cannot move into a space you already occupied this
                        turn.
                      * You can only enter/exit elevated/enclosed spaces
                        via the designated locations.
                      * After your movement is complete, write the current
                        number on the countdown track on your final space on
                        your hidden board.
                - name: Shooting
                  text: |
                      The tokens in your bag are (potentially):

                      * [Grey]!grey! aim tokens - these are needed to hit.
                      * [Yellow]!#fbe55e! recoil tokens - can cause misfires.
                      * [Red]!red! noise tokens - these reveal your position
                        if 2+ are drawn.
                      * [Blue]!blue! suppression tokens - these "cancel" out
                        noise tokens when deciding if you reveal your position.

                      **Note**: You **cannot** shoot from your starting
                      position.

                      Note that the shot bag tokens **are limited**.

                      The process for shooting is:

                      1. Secretly choose your target in [line of sight](#los).
                      2. Count the shortest number of spaces to said unit.
                      3. Declare how many tokens you will draw from the bag
                         for all to hear.
                      4. Draw the tokens from the bag (visible to everyone) and
                         resolve the results.
                          * If you drew at least 1 aim token for each space
                            to the target's space, you hit. e.g. If the target
                            is 3 spaces away, you need 3 aim tokens. **If
                            you are in the same space as the target, you still
                            need at least 1 aim token**. Remove the target
                            from the board.
                              * If you killed a soldier, add an aim token to
                                the shot bag.
                              * If you killed an officer, add the suppression
                                token from their card to the shot bag. If
                                you've already done that, add an aim token
                                instead.
                          * If you drew 2+ noise tokens, reveal your position
                            by placing your mini on the board. Remember that
                            each suppression token will cancel out a noise
                            token for this purpose.
                          * If you draw 5+, combined, recoil and noise tokens
                            (**regardless of suppression tokens**), you misfire
                            and miss your shot.
                          * After resolution, return all tokens to the shot
                            bag.
                - name: Looting
                  text: |
                      If you are in a numbered space that is **not** one of
                      your objectives, you can loot.

                      * Announce that you are looting, but **do not reveal your
                        location**.
                      * Draw 3 loadout cards and choose 1 to keep.
                      * Shuffle the unkept cards back into the deck.
                      * Mark the looted space on your hidden board, you cannot
                        loot this space again.

                  text: |
                      **You have 10 rounds to complete each objective!** If
                      the countdown track ever runs out, you have lost.

                      If you are on the space matching 1 of your objectives:

                      * Reveal your objective card.
                      * Put your mini on the space.
                      * Reset the defenders action cubes to the 10 space on
                        the countdown track.
                      * Add 1 noise token to the shot bag.
                - name: Using Loadout Cards
                  text: |
                      Loadout cards grant a **1 time** special ability.

                      To use a card:

                      * Declare you are using a loadout.
                      * Place the card face down on the table. Reveal it at
                        the time specified on the card.
                      * Loadout cards **cannot** be played midway through
                        another action or movement.
                      * If a loadout card would affect other actions on your
                        turn, it must be played **before** those actions.
          - name: The Defenders
            text: |
                As the defenders, you are trying to wound the sniper twice
                or slow them down in completing objectives.

                * As actions are taken, move an action cube down to the next
                  number down on the countdown track.
                * Actions can be interleaved between the different squads
                  (colors).
                * Actions can be completed in any order between all units.
                * Before or after any action, each officer may use their
                  specialist ability **once per round**.
                * **A single soldier or officer cannot do the same move
                  twice**. e.g. A single soldier cannot take a move action
                  twice.

                      * **This moves both action cubes on the countdown track
                        for that squad's color**.
                      * Declare the "intel" action and the sniper either
                        confirms they are in that same colored zone or not.

                      Each action listed here moves 1 action cube down
                      on the countdown track.

                      * **Movement**:
                          * Move up to 2 spaces.
                          * Units can move through other units.
                          * Units cannot share a space at the end of the
                            movement.
                      * **Attack**:
                          * Choose a unit on the board.
                          * If the sniper is in the same space, they place
                            their mini there and flip the wound token to
                            the wounded side.  If it is the 2nd wound, the
                            sniper is killed and the defenders win.
                      * **Spot**:
                          * Choose a space adjacent to a unit.
                          * If the sniper is in that space, they must place
                            their mini there and add 1 noise token to their
                            shot bag.
                      * **Sweep**:
                          * Choose 2 [matching-adjacent](#maps) spaces to a
                            unit.
                          * If the sniper is in either of those spaces or
                            the space with the declaring unit, they must
                            say they are there, but **they do not reveal
                            which space**.
                      * **Deploy Officer**:
                          * If the squad's officer is off the board, put him
                            on his matching starting space for that color.
                      * **Deploy Soldier**:
                          * If the squad's officer is in their own colored
                            zone, place a soldier of that color not on the
                            board in a [matching-adjacent](#maps) space next
                            to the officer.
                          * The soldier may be placed in a different colored
                            zone if the officer is on the edge of their zone.
                          * This counts as an action for the soldier being
                            deployed. This means 2 different soldiers can be
                            deployed (and it is not considered a duplicate
                            action).
                      * **Dismiss**:
                          * Remove one of the squad's units (officer or
                            soldier) from the board. **They cannot be deployed
                            this round**.

                        2 cubes on the specialist card represent this).
                      * Only **officers** can use the abilities.
                      * Officers do **not** have to be in their own zone to
                        use the ability.
                      * When the ability is used, remove 1 of the action cubes

                        per round**.
                      * If the ability modifies an action, you must use the
                        ability **before** taking that action.
                      * If an ability refers to "soldier(s)", it can **only**
                        be used on soldiers, not officers.
                      * Abilities that prevent a specific unit from taking
                        an action do not prevent the squad from [gathering

            space the target is on, **without going through an enclosed space**.
          * You can shoot into or out of an enclosed space (windows).
          * If you are in a building or room, you have line of sight to every
            other space in said building.
          * You cannot trace line of sight *through* enclosed spaces either:
              * From an open space.
              * From an enclosed space to an open space.
          * From an elevated space, every other elevated space is in line of
            sight unless it would pass through an obstruction.
          * When targeting other elevated spaces, you can shoot over open or
            enclosed spaces below you.

            black sectors.  There may be more than 1 neutral (white) sector.
          * Defenders may leave their sector at any point.
          * Each space can only have 1 defender, but defenders can move
            through spaces with another defender.
          * If a defender moves into the space with the sniper, **the sniper
            says nothing**.
          * Spaces are adjacent if they share an edge.
          * Spaces are **matching-adjacent** if they share an edge and are the
