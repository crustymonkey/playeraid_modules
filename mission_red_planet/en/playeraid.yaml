        * Construct the launchpad by connecting a number of docks equal to the number of players.
        * Shuffle the ships and place one in each dock. Unknown destination cards should be replaced.
        * Randomly place one astronaut on each ship. Color closest to the left is the starting player.
        * Randomly place resource tokens face down on Mars and Phobos. There should be one left over.
        * Separate out mission cards and deal 2 to each player. Choose 1 and put the other back in the deck. Shuffle the discovery and action cards into the mission deck.

        - name: Choose Character
          text: |
            Each player secretly chooses a character card from their hand.
        - name: Resolve Character Effects
          text: |
            Count down from 9 to 1. Players play their cards when their number is called and resolve the effect. If two or more players are tied, start from the starting player and go clockwise around the table. If a ship does not yet have a destination, the first player to enter it picks a location plaque from the pile.  
            A ship automatically launches once it is full.
        - name: Land Launched Ships
          text: |
            Land launched ships in their specified zone after all players have played their cards. If the resource tile there is face down, flip it over. 
        - name: Draw New Docket Ships
          text: |
            Fill all empty spaces with new ships.
        - name: Assign New First Player
          text: |
            Whomever was the last to resolve their card’s ability becomes the new first player.

            Move the turn gauge one step. 
    - name: Production Phases
      text: |
        The sections with 1, 2, and 3 dots are production phases. Each zone with a face up resource produces tokens of its type equal to the number of downs shown on the dial. Tokens are distributed to the players with the majority of astronauts in a zone. If tied, tokens are distributed evenly with any leftovers staying in the zone for the next time. If there are no longer any astronauts in a zone, nobody claims the tokens.
    - name: Reveal Discovery Phase
      text: |
        When the dial hits the atom symbol, all discovery cards on the table are flipped over. These cards are resolved when the dial hits the space that matches the icon in their lower-right corner. 
    - name: Final Scoring
      text: |
        * Players reveal their mission cards and determine if they’re completed.
        * The player with the most Ice tokens gets the Ice Monopoly bonus mission card.
        * Points from completed missions + value of collected point tokens +/- discovery bonuses.
    - name: Discovery Cards
      text: |
        When a player draws a discovery card (through the Scientist action) they must immediately play it to an outer zone on Mars. A zone may have more than one card.
    - name: Phobos
      text: |
        Phobos behaves like all other zones of Mars except that it is not adjacent to any other space and cannot have discovery cards assigned to it.
