    text: |
      * Place the main board.
      * Place the "X" tiles, wheel enhancements, farm enhancements, tulip
        bulbs, and tool tokens near the board.
      * Shuffle each type of wheel enhancement tiles separately, forming
        stacks face down. Place them near the main board.
          * Draw 2 common, 1 uncommon, and 1 unique enhancements and place
            them on their spaces on the main board.
      * Shuffle the farm enhancements into a face down deck and place it
        near the main board.
          * Draw 3 farm enhancements and place them in any order face up
            on their spaces on the main board.
      * Place the floodgate marker and the water level marker on their lowest
        numbered positions on their tracks.
      * Shuffle the foreign trade cards and place them in a face up stack on
        the main board.
      * Choose a 1st player.
      * Give each player:
          * 1 farm board
          * 1 windmill board (randomly chosen) rotated so the red arrow lines
            up with the red spoke on the larger gear.
          * 1 player aid
          * 1 tool token
          * 9 windmill tokens (in their color)
          * 5 player markers (in their color)
      * Each player places their player markers:
          * On the "5" space of the VP track
          * The starting position of the calendar track
          * On the guilder track on their farm boards:
              * 1st player: 4th position
              * 2nd player: 5th position
              * 3rd player: 6th position
              * 4th player: 7th position
      * Randomly choose a number of starting farm enhancements equal to the
        number of players + 1 and place them face up.
          * In **reverse** turn order, each player chooses 1 card and places
            it under the top leftmost slot of their farm board (showing the
            top half of the card).
          * Place the remaining card on the main board next to the calendar,
            flipping it to the queen's wish side.
      * In **reverse** turn order, each player places 1 of their larger player
        markers on an area of the market without another player marker (if
        possible).
        Then:
          * 2 players: Place 1 neutral marker in each of the 3 areas of the
            market.
          * 3 players: Place 1 neutral marker in each of the 2 areas of the
            market that don't have the 1st player's marker.
          * 4 players: Place 1 neutral marker in the next area
            counter-clockwise from the 1st player's marker.
          * Return any remaining neutral markers to the box.
      * Players should set aside their 5th player marker for now.
      * Players then receive:
          * 1st player: 1 white tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 2nd player: 1 yellow tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 3rd player: 1 red tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
          * 4th player: 1 violet tulip bulb (placed in their storage)
      * Each player should place their windmills into groups, in the slots
        on the left side of their farm board (top to bottom: 1/1/2/2/3).
      * If playing with less than 4 players cover the respective part of the
        calendar with the limit tile, leaving the last column of the calendar
        uncovered.

      Players will continuously take turns until someone reaches the end of
      the calendar track, which triggers the [game end](#game_end). You will
      then finish the current round (equal turns) and then play 1 more turn.

      # General Rules
      * You cannot have more than 9 guilders or less than zero.
      * If at any point, a player fulfills the Queen's Wish, they place 1 of
        their markers on the highest available VP space and gain the VP.
      * A white number next to a symbol indicates how much of that you gain.
      * A red number next to a symbol indicates how much of that you have to
        spend.
      * Rewards are optional.
      * When you gain tulip bulbs, they are always placed in your storage from
        left to right.
          * The 2 rightmost spots have a cost.
          * If your storage is full, you may discard a bulb and replace it
            with a new bulb you've gained.
              * The cost is not paid when exchanging tulip bulbs already in
                these spaces when doing this.
    sections:
      - name: "1. Floodgate Adjustment"
        text: |
          * You may open or close the floodgates during this step.  This will
            determine how much your wheels move.
          * You have 3 choices:
              * Leave the floodgate where it is.
              * Close the floodgate by moving it down any number of steps.
              * Open the floodgate by moving it up any number of steps, but
                paying the guilder cost for each step (and receiving the VP
                reward(s)).
          * You **can only move the floodgate in 1 direction** on your turn.
          * You **cannot** set the floodgate to a level that would move the
            water level off of its track.
          * If the water level is at the maximum, you **must** decrease the
            floodgate level (water speed) to 1.
      - name: "2. Water Level Adjustment"
        text: |
          * Move the water level to the right a number of spaces based on the
            current floodgate level (water speed):
              * Level 1: 0 spaces
              * Level 2: 1 spaces
              * Level 3: 2 spaces
          * The water level can **never** move off the end of the track.
              * You **cannot** set the floodgate to a level that would move the
                water level off of its track.
      - name: "3. Wheel Movement"
        text: |
          * Move your gears clockwise a number of steps equal to the floodgate
            level (water speed).
              * You may increase or decrease how far it moves by spending
                a tool for each step.
                  * Using tools does not affect the floodgate level.
              * **You must always move the wheel at least 1 space and never
                more than 4 spaces**.
          * Whenever the red spoke on your wheel meets/crosses the red arrow
            on your board, move your marker 1 space to the right on the
            calendar track.
              * Receive the reward shown on the space and, if available, claim
                a unique reward in the same column.  After claiming the unique
                reward, cover it with a red "X".
              * When a player reaches the end of the calendar track, [game
                end](#game_end) is triggered.
      - name: "4. Perform Actions"
        text: |
          * You may select 1 of the 2 actions.
              * You **must take 1 of the 2 actions if at all possible**.
          * If you cannot perform either action, instead take 2 guilders.
          * If 1 of the 2 actions has a "+" symbol, you may perform both
            actions in any order.
          * Some effects may grant you extra actions.
              * If, due to this, you perform the same action twice, note that
                they are considered separate, distinct actions.

          ## Action: Lower the Water Level
          ![low_water](/static/img/windmill_valley/low_wat_level.png)

          1. Gain the reward for the **current** level of the water level
             marker once for each strength level of the action.  e.g. If the
             marker is on the 8 space and you have a 2 strength action, you
             would receive either 4 guilders or 4 VP.
              * Note that you still receive 1 coin even if the track is at
                its bottom space.
          2. Lower the water level a number of spaces equal to the action's
             strength.

          ## Action: Enhance the Wheels
          ![whl_enh](/static/img/windmill_valley/whl_enh.png)

          * Before selecting an enhancement, you may spend 1 guilder to discard
            all the current enhancements to the bottom of their respective
            piles and replace them.
          * Take a wheel enhancement token from the board and cover an existing
            action on 1 of your wheels, paying the cost.
              * Common: Free
              * Uncommon: 1 guilder
              * Unique: 2 guilders
          * You may replace a previously installed enhancement, returning
            the replaced 1 to the box.
          * **You cannot install an enhancement on a space you activated this
            turn**.
          * Refill the board spot with a matching enhancement.
              * If the matching type has run out, replace it with a common
                enhancement and cover the cost with a red "X" (it is now free).

          ## Action: Gain a Farm Enhancement
          ![farm_enh](/static/img/windmill_valley/farm_enh.png)

          * Before selecting an enhancement, you may spend 1 guilder to
            discard all the current enhancements to the discard and replace
            them from the deck.
          * Select a card and slot it under your board as either a "helper"
            (top half) or a "contract" (bottom half).
              * If used as a helper, you slot it in the leftmost spot and
                gain the points shown for that slot.
          * Immediately refill the supply when taking a card.
          * Helpers can be used **once per turn** and they can be used
            immediately after placement.
              * Helper abilities can be used before or after your action(s).
          * If your slots are full for either contracts or helpers, you can
            replace an existing card.
              * If you are replacing a helper, you **do not gain the VP for
                the slot you are replacing**.
              * Add the removed card to the discard pile.

          ## Action: Build a Windmill
          ![windmill](/static/img/windmill_valley/windmill.png)

          * Take any windmill from your board, pay the cost next to the
            windmill space and place it on the main board following the
            placement rules.
              * The windmill must be connected to the market **via an
                uninterrupted path of windmills** of any color.
              * Only 1 windmill can be placed in a space.
          * After placing a windmill, do the following:
              1. Tracing the shortest path possible back to the market, all
                 **other players** receive 1 VP for each windmill on this
                 path.
                  * **You do not receive points for any of your windmills
                    on this path**.
              2. Receive all the rewards from any fields adjacent to your
                 newly placed windmill.
          * There are some enhancements that allow you to build windmills
            that are not connected to the market.
              * No one can build off of these windmills! They must follow
                the rule where they are connected to the market.

          ## Action: Visit the Market
          ![market](/static/img/windmill_valley/market.png)

          * You pay the cost shown to move your marker clockwise a number
            of spaces in the market equal to the strength of the action.
          * **Once per turn, before you move**, you can pay 1 guilder to move
            a neutral marker from 1 area of the market to another.
              * It **must** move to an area that you will move to during some
                part of your movement.
          * For each movement point (strength of the action), move your token
            1 space clockwise and collect 1 of the rewards shown a number of
            times equal to the number of tokens in that market area (max of 3).
              * e.g. If you move to an area with 2 tokens (including your own),
                you would collect 2x of your chosen reward.
          * If an area is full, you may pay 1 guilder to another player and
            place your token on top of theirs.
              * You still only collect a max of 3x of a reward.
              * This does not prevent movement of the other player in any
                way.

          ## Action: Plant Tulip Bulbs
          ![plant](/static/img/windmill_valley/plant.png)

          * Plant a number of tulip bulbs equal to the action's strength
            from your storage to your tulip patches.
          * You may plant any tulip bulb from your storage.
          * You must plant in the leftmost spot of any row.
          * If you cover a reward on the space, gain that immediately.
          * After planting, slide the remaining tulip bulbs in your storage
            to the left so there are no open spaces on the left side.

          ## Action: Conduct Foreign Trade
          ![trade](/static/img/windmill_valley/trade.png)

          * You have 2 options with this action:
              * Place a tulip bulb from your storage on the foreign trade card
                and receive rewards.
                  * The bulb must be of a different color than any others
                    on the card.
                  * The bulb is placed between 2 quarters of the card and you
                    receive the reward from both quarters.
              * **OR** take all the tulip bulbs from the card, returning any
                you don't want to the supply.
          * If, after placing a tulip bulb on the card, the card has 4 bulbs
            on it, remove all the bulbs and place them in the supply.  Then,
            place the card at the bottom of its deck.
  - name: Game End
    id: game_end
    text: |
      When a player reaches the last space of the calendar track, game end is
      triggered. Finish out the current round (equal turns), then each player
      gets 1 more turn.

      ## Scoring
      * Gain points for contracts.
      * Each empty windmill group will score points for different colors of
        tulip bulbs in your patch (not your storage). Top to bottom:
          * 1 VP per white bulb
          * 1 VP per yellow bulb
          * 2 VP per red bulb
          * 2 VP per violet bulb
          * 3 VP per black bulb
      * Score points for each completed row/column in your patch.
          * X points for a complete row where all the tulips are the same
            color.
          * X (smaller) points for a complete row where they are not all the
            same color.
          * X points for each column with 4 different colors of tulip bulbs.
          * **-X points** for each column with 2 or more of the same color
            bulb, **complete or incomplete**.

      The player with the VP wins.  If there is a tie:

      1. The player with the most tulip bulbs in the patch wins.
      2. The player with the most tulip bulbs in their storage wins.
      3. The player with the most windmills on the main board wins.
      4. Tied players share the victory.
