                  * Do **not** replenish the card in the display.
              * (or) Take cards from the top of the deck.
                  * If the display is empty, take 2.
                  * If the display is not empty, take 1.
                  * If you draw a monkey card, place it face up on the table
                    near the deck and then draw another card.
                      * If this is the 3rd monkey card drawn, the [season
                        ends](#seasonend) immediately.
          * (or) Play an expedition. An expedition consists of a number of
            cards from your hand played face up as a set in front of you.
              * Cards in an expedition must all be the same color or all the
                same [role](#roles) (character art).

                of the splayed stack of cards.
                  * If your expedition size is large enough, you may advance
                    your vehicle at the site with the matching color. The
                    size of the expedition (number of cards) must be >= to
                    the requirement size to cross the next line on the board.
                      * You can **never advance more than 1 space with a single
                        expedition**.
                      * Note that you can play an expedition even if you
                        can't advance on the track.
                      * If your leader is a Student, do **not** advance your
                        vehicle at the site, regardless of expedition size.
                  * You may use the effect of your leader's [role](#roles).
              * After resolving the expedition, all other cards not in the
                expedition are added to the display (you will have zero cards
                left).

            space of the track.
      * **Season end**: Do **not** gain points for the position of your
        vehicle as you would normally do with locations at season end. Points
        can only be gained on this track via the above "vehicle advances".

        each player may immediately play a single expedition (resolving it
        as normal).
          * **Note**: The maximum size of the expedition played depends on
            your vehicle's position on the Ur track.
