          *  Give each player 2 Peasant cards and a player aid.  Place your
             player aid on the table as it also serves as a barn.
          *  Build the Traveler deck based on the player count and game length:

          | Players | Short Game | Long Game |
          | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
          | 2 players | remove 35 cards | remove 25 cards |
          | 3 players | remove 28 cards | remove 16 cards |
          | 4 players | remove 22 cards | remove 6 cards |

          *  Shuffle the remaining cards and place the cards at the left of
             the board with the living side face-up.
          *  Each player receives 8 key/room service tokens and disc in their
             player color.  Place the disc on the 5F space of the wealth track.
          *  Each player takes 1 10F check.
          *  Determine which rooms are open:
              *  Each player places a key token of their color on an unclaimed
                 room of their choice.
              *  In a 2 or 3 player game, place a key token of the neutral
                 color on each of 3 doors of the inn.  In a 4 player game,
                 place 1 on each of the 4.
          * The greediest player takes the first player card.
    - name: Playing the Game
      text: |
          The game is divided into 2 seasons.  A season is traversal through
          the deck.  When the Entrance stack becomes empty for the 1st time,
          shuffle the Exit stack to form a new Entrance stack. After the 2nd
          time through the deck, do a normal final round, even if the inn is
          not full. **Don't play the final round if there are fewer travelers
          in the inn than the number of players**.

          Each round is divided into 3 phases.
      sections:
          - name: "Phase 1: Welcome Travelers (Evening)"
            text: |
                The 1st player performs the following steps:

                *  Draw the top card of the Entrance stack
                *  Place the traveler in an open (has a key token), unoccupied
                   (has no traveler) room of their choice
                *  Reiterate this process until there is a traveler in each
                   open room
          - name: "Phase 2: Player Actions (Night)"
            text: |
                Starting with the 1st player, in clockwise order each player
                performs an action.  Then go around once more so each player
                can perform a 2nd action.

                There are 5 different actions you may take on your turn:

                1. Bribe a Guest
                2. Build an Annex
                3. Kill a Guest
                4. Bury a Corpse
                5. Pass (and Launder Money)

                Actions 1-4 operate on the same principle:
                
                *  You choose a Guest card in play (in your hand or in the inn,
                   as appropriate)
                *  You must play a number of cards defined by the rank of the
                   chosen card
                *  Reclaim any cards you played that have an aptitude for the
                   chosen action.  The other cards are lost.
                *  Perform the action
            sections:
                - name: 1. Bribe a Guest
                  text: |
                      This allows you to take a Guest card from the inn into
                      your hand.

                      *  Select the traveler you want to bribe from among those
                         renting rooms at the inn (the room owner does not
                         matter).
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards just played, return any cards with the
                         ![money](/static/img/bloody_inn/money.png) icon to
                         your hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Add the bribed guest to your hand

                      It is also possible to **bribe the peasants** in the
                      bistro.  If you bribe the peasants, take 1 or 2 and them
                      to your hand.
                - name: 2. Build an Annex
                  text: |
                      This allows you to place one of your Guest cards in
                      your hand in front of you to use its power.  Annexes
                      are also needed to bury corpses.

                      *  Choose a traveler **from your hand** that depicts an
                         annex.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards just played, return cards with the
                         ![trowel](/static/img/bloody_inn/trowel.png)
                         icon to your hand. Put the other cards in the exit
                         stack, **except Peasants, which go in the bistro
                         instead**.
                      *  Place the traveler card in front of you, Living side
                         face-up.  This is now an annex.  There is no limit
                         to the number of annexes you can have.  You can also
                         have more than 1 copy of the same annex.
                      
                      **Note**: Police and Peasant cards **cannot** become
                      annexes.
                - name: 3. Kill a Guest
                  text: |
                      When you kill a guest, you put them in front of you
                      Dead-side-up.

                      *  Select the traveler you want to kill **from the inn**.
                         It's also possible to kill Peasants.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards played, return cards with the
                         ![gun](/static/img/bloody_inn/gun.png) icon to your
                         hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Place the Guest card in front of you with the Dead
                         side face up (this is now a **corpse**).  There is no
                         limit to the number of corpses you can have in
                         front of you.
                - name: 4. Bury a Corpse
                  text: |
                      You may bury the **corpse** of a guest you **killed in
                      a previous action**.

                      *  Select the corpse you want to bury from those in
                         front of you.
                      *  Play as many Guest cards from your hand as the rank
                         of the traveler you chose.
                      *  From the cards played, return cards with the
                         ![casket](/static/img/bloody_inn/casket.png) icon to
                         your hand .  Put the other cards in the exit stack,
                         **except Peasants, which go in the bistro instead**.
                      *  Place the corpse card under an annex of your choice,
                         **regardless of who owns it**, leaving the bottom
                         of the card (with the money amount) showing.  The
                         number of bodies you can bury under an annex is
                         equal to the rank of the annex.  **You and the
                         owner of the annex** split the money (you get all
                         of it if buried under your own annex).  Note that
                         you **can bury a corpse under the "barn"**.
                      
                      **Important**: It is **impossible** to have more than
                      40 francs on the wealth track.  If you would exceed
                      40, the excess is lost.

                  text: |
                      You can choose not to do any of the previous actions and
                      pass instead.  If you do, you *may* "Launder Money".
                      You can either:
                      
                      *  Exchange a portion of your cash for 10F checks.
                      *  Cash checks in order to increase your cash on the
                         wealth track.

                      If there is **at least 1 Police card in an open room**
                      at the inn, the police investigate.  Each player must
                      pat 10F per unburied corpse they have, and then
                      remove all unburied corpses from the game.

                      **Note**: You **can** pay with checks.  If you can't
                      pay the full amount, pay all the money you have.

                      Each player earns 1F for each room of their color
                      (each door with a key token of their color) with a
                      Guest card.

                      Then, empty the inn, placing all travelers on the exit
                      stack living side up.

                      Pay 1F per Guest card in your hand.  You **cannot** pay
                      them with checks!  If you cannot pay for all the
                      Guest cards in your hand, you must put unpaid cards on
                      the exit stack, except for Peasants, which go in the
                      bistro.

                      Rotate the First Player card to the left and a new
                      round can begin.
    - name: End of the Game
      text: |
          *  When the Entrance Stack is emptied for the **2nd** time, finish
             the round and the game ends.
          *  **Note**: Do **not** play the last round if there are fewer
             travelers in the inn than there are players.
          *  Each player with an unburied corpse must pay 10F per unburied
             corpse, then remove them from the game.
          *  Evaluate the rank-3 annexes that earn you money.  **Note: You
             still cannot have more than 40F on the wealth track!**
          *  Total up each players wealth: wealth track + checks
          *  The richest player wins
              *  **In the event of a tie**, the player with the most corpses
                 under their annexes wins.  If there is still a tie, the
                 game ends in a tie.
