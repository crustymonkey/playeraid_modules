          ## Bandits

            ends and a fight is started

          ### Fighing a Bandit
          1. The active player chooses 1 poker card and plays it face down.
          2. The player to the right of the active player draws 2 fight cards
             and chooses 1 to play face down.
          3. Reveal both cards and then apply effects from characters, items,
             etc.
          4. The active player may play any number of reaction cards.
          5. The effects from the played fight card are resolved.
          6. The highest value wins the fight with the **active player losing
             ties**.
          7. If the bandit is defeated, the player gains either 1 LP **or** 1
             marshal point.
              * Wanted players may not choose to gain a marshal point.
          8. Remove the bandit from the board regardless of outcome.
          9. Discard all played poker cards and return the fight cards to the
             bottom of the fight deck (random order).

          ## The Sheriff
          * The sheriff starts at the sheriff's office in Darkrock.
          * As long as there is at least 1 wanted player, the sheriff will move
            when a story card dictates it.
          * The sheriff can also be moved via the Manhunt poker card (again,
            as long as there is at least 1 wanted player).
          * If the sheriff enters a space with a wanted player, the player must
            immediately discard 1 poker card, if they have any.
              * If there are 2+ wanted players in the space, the person who
                moved the sheriff decides who discards.

          ### Arrest Attempt
          1. The wanted player places 1 poker card face down.
          2. The player to the right of the wanted player draws 4 fight cards
             and plays 1 face down.
          3. Reveal both cards and apply any effects from characters, items,
             etc.
          4. The active player may play any number of reactions.
          5. Apply the effects from the fight card.
          6. The highest value wins, with the active player **losing** ties.
          7. Discard the played poker cards and put the fight cards on the
             bottom of its deck in random order.

          * If the sheriff arrests the wanted player, they are placed at the
            sheriff's office **with the sheriff** and they:
              * Gain 1 wound
              * Draw 1 poker card
              * Lose all wanted points
              * Lose all cattle
              * Lose half their money, rounded up
