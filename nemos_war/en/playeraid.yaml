            * If this is a Lull Turn:
                * Place a gemstone on the Ocean matching their pair of dice you chose. If that Ocean already has a gemstone, place one in an adjacent Ocean that does not have a gemstone. If all adjacent Oceans have one, skip this step.
                * Place 1 gemstone on top of the Adventure Deck.
                * For each Ocean that has Uprising cubes:
                    * Add the number of Uprising cubes and revealed Ship tokens in this Ocean and roll 1d6.
            * If result >= the sum, nothing happens.
