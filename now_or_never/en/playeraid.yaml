            text: |
                Pay a specialist to perform their action.  Choose one of the
                following:

                * *Pay your own specialist*.  Pay the upper coin amount to the
                  supply and take the action.
                * *Pay another player's specialist*. Pay the upper coin amount
                  to the supply. The player with the specialist collects the
                  small coin amount from the supply.  Then take the action.
                * *Recruit a new specialist*. Pay **double** the upper coin
                  amount to the supply. Take the specialist and place them in
                  an open slot. If there are no open slots, you may replace
                  a specialist (used or unused). Take the specialist's action.
                  **Draw a new specialist and place it in the row**.

                Flip the specialist you just used face down. The specialist
                cannot be used again this season.

                You may pay a specialist and perform no action or a partial
                action.  You still flip them face down.

                      * If you place the building on a space with a resource,
                        gain 1 of that resource.
                      * If you place the building on a space with a
                        "coins: build" icon, you must pay the additional coins
                        to build there.
                      * If the building you place has a book with an arrow icon,

                    * You may move a number of spaces up to the number on the

                    * **You cannot move diagonally**.
                    * When you enter a space with a mountain icon, **lose 
                      1 heart**.
                    * If you enter a space and don't fight it, **lose 1 heart**.
                      You may continue moving though.
                2. *Play a [quest card](#quests) (optional)*: On the space you

                  text: |
                      Locations have a name on a scroll with an action below
                      the scroll.  You may perform the action on the location.
                      See [Locations](#locations) for more info.
                - name: Fight an Enemy
                  text: |
                      If you stop on an enemy, you can fight it.

                      1. Roll a die. Check the result on your [red]!red! combat
                         abilities. Deal any damage listed on the ability. **The
                         enemy attacks you simultaneously**, losing hearts equal
                         to the enemy's damage. Be sure to subtract any defense
                         you have.
                      2. If you've dealt cumulative damage equal to the enemy's
                         health, it's defeated.  Otherwise, start a new combat
                         round (goto #1) or retreat. If you defeated the enemy,
                         gain the rewards, then discard the enemy token.
                      3. If you have [run out hearts](#out_of_hearts), you
                         lose and your turn ends immediately. **Remember,
                         combat is simultaneous so you can lose even if you've
                         defeated the enemy!**
                      4. To retreat, leave your hero where they are, but your
                         turn ends.
                      5. If you retreat or run out of hearts, the enemy token
                         remains on the board, but you gain 1 experience token.

                      If you get a villager reward, take one of the face up
                      villagers. **If there are no villagers left**, draw 6 new
                      villagers.

                      **Note about abilities/gear**: Some abilities/gear allow
                      you to receive other benefits **if you pay mana for
                      them**. Some [blue]!blue! abilities do not cost mana.

                  text: |
                      * When on a space with a search token, you may roll a die
                        and lose hearts equal to the die roll. **If you [end up
                        with zero hearts](#out_of_hearts), your turn ends and
                        you do not get the search token**.
                      * After rolling, take the search token and gain the reward
                        on the opposite side. Then, place the token face down
                        near your town board as it **provides 1 coin during each
                        production phase**.
                      * If the search token tells you to discard it, **do not
                        keep it**.

            text: |

                next season.  Once all players pass, the production phase
                begins.

                      * If you don't have room for a new villager, place it
                        below your town board.  You may "house" it later when
                        you acquire a building for it.
