          * Note that there are may be special setup rules on it.
          * Put out the starting ocean boards, as is shown on the scenario
            sheet.
              * Note that the scenario shows you how wide you can expand out.
              * **Any ocean boards with the "sun" symbol next to the name
                should not be used unless they are explicitly part of the
                scenario**.
      * Shuffle the remaining ocean tiles for each respective depth and create
        a stack for each.

  - name: Gameplay
    text: |
      The game is played over the course of 6 rounds, with each round consisting
      of 2 phases.  Each phase is played in turn order starting with the
      player with the wave.
    sections:
      - name: "Phase 1: Preparation"
        text: |
          This phase is broken into 3 simple parts that each player completes
          before moving to the next player.

          ## Recruitment a Specialist
          * Chose 1 specialist that you can recruit based on your level
            on the reputation track.
              * The specialist must match your highest available tier or below.
              * You always get specialists on their junior side (blue).
              * Immediately take any instant bonuses (left side) shown on the
                specialist.
              * You may recruit duplicates of the same specialist.
              * Any "Inspiration" (green) or "Coordination" (yellow) track
                gains **are** usable in the next steps.
              * If you recruit a tier 5 specialist and it leaves an empty
                slot in the tray, move the top tile from another slot to
                this 1.

          ## Effort
          * Gain a number of discs from your supply into the staging area
            on your player board based on your level of the green track.

          ## Reassignment
          * Reclaim discs assigned on your specialists in the previous round
            according to the level of your yellow track.
              * You **cannot** remove discs placed on journals.
              * You **cannot** remove discs from ocean tiles.
              * You can retrieve the disc from your team leader in the 1st
                round.

      - name: "Phase 2: Activation"
        text: |
          Players take turns or pass during this phase.  Once you pass, you
          can no longer take turns during the round.  This continues until
          all players have passed.

          ## Taking Turns
          * This is *usually* done by placing a disc from your staging area
            onto 1 of your specialists to take the action(s) shown on it.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions separated by a "/".  You
                can only choose 1 of those actions.
              * Some specialists show multiple actions **not** separated by a
                "/".  You may perform all actions shown in any order.
                  * The actions may be performed in different zones.
                  * Multiple actions still count as a single turn.
                  * Each action must be fully resolved before activating the
                    other action.
                  * You can activate a specialist and not take its action.
              * Some actions will require you to place a 2nd disc from your
                staging area onto an ocean board to activate it.
          * If you have a journal with a special activation circle, you can
            place a disc from your staging area onto those to activate them.
              * This is done **instead of activating a specialist**.
          * You can always decline any reward or action you are entitled to.
          * To perform the action, you must have a sub in a zone with a
            matching action available.
              * Actions are always performed in the same zone as one of your
                subs, unless otherwise specified.
          * If you ever reach the impact symbol near the end of a track, gain
            1 impact.
              * If you ever advance beyond the end of a track, move your
                marker back to the impact spot and gain 1 impact (as shown).
          * If you reach a sub icon on the blue track, place a sub on the
            launch zone (for the scenario) and gain the arrival bonus.
              * This happens only the 1st time you reach each sub.
        sections:
          - name: "Action: Travel"
            text: |
              * Move your sub to a different zone and gain the arrival bonus
                of the zone where your movement ends.  This will allow you
                to take future actions in that zone.
                  * The max depth is determined by your location on the blue
                    track. e.g. if it shows 3 ingenuity symbols, you can dive
                    to depth 3.
                  * Your level on the blue track also determines the number of
                    zones you can move when taking this action.
                      * All movement is **orthogonal**. Subs cannot move
                        diagonally.
                      * You may not travel through empty spaces.
                  * The arrival bonus is shown below the travel symbol.
              * Note that new subs that are launched to the launch zone **do**
                get the arrival bonus of that zone.
          - name: "Action: Sonar (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Place a disc from your staging area onto the leftmost circle
                for a sonar action space and take any bonus shown there.
                  * If a zone has multiple sonar actions, you may place your
                    disc in the leftmost space of either.
                  * Some spaces will give you a link bonus.
                      * If you complete a link, you and the other player both
                        receive the bonus shown between the 2 discs.
                          * If both discs are yours, you only get the bonus
                            **once**.
              * If the space shows a "discover" symbol, perform a discover
                action:
                  1. Draw **2** ocean boards from the depths shown.  e.g. if
                     the symbol shows "3+", you could take 2 from depth 3, 4,
                     or 5, or 1 board from any 2 depths.
                      * You can draw from depths you cannot travel to.
                      * Note that the scenario sheet shows how wide your
                        ocean area can be.
                      * Aside from depth 1, there **must** be a zone of a
                        shallower depth to place it below.  e.g. you cannot
                        place a depth 4 tile in a column with no depth 3 tile.
                      * If your discovery is impossible to resolve, you must
                        draw from the shallowest possible depth.  e.g. if your
                        discovery is 1-2 and depth 1 and 2 are full.
                      * If the entire play area is full, gain impact instead
                        and skip the remaining steps.
                      * **If a drawn board has a sun symbol next to the name**
                        and it is not listed on your scenario, discard it and
                        draw a replacement.
                  2. Look at both boards and choose 1 to place.
                      * Place the board in a legal (above) space and place the
                        other board back at the bottom of its depth stack.
                      * If the zone has a dive site(s), place the specified
                        number of tokens face down on its space(s).
                  3. Claim the discovery bonus (1 time rewards in the top
                     left corner).
                      * Note that the bonus area will have a reminder to place
                        dive tokens on the board if it has a dive site(s).
          - name: "Action: Dive"
            text: |
              * Draw the top dive token from a zone you have a sub and reveal
                it.
              * When spending a token, you either take the action or get the
                amount of pictured research.
              * You may spend a dive token before, after, or between your
                actions.
              * You may spend a dive token **instead of activating a
                specialist** for your turn.
              * You may spend tokens on the same turn you acquire them.
              * You may spend a max of 1 token on your player board at the
                end of your turn.
                  * Any excess unspent tokens are lost.
              * You may spend any number of dive tokens on your turn.
              * If the supply runs out, shuffle the discard to form a new
                supply.
          - name: "Action: Conserve (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Pay the research cost for a space in a zone where you have
                a sub and place a disc from your staging area to get the
                displayed bonus(es). 
                  * Some spaces will give you a link bonus.
                      * If you complete a link, you and the other player both
                        receive the bonus shown between the 2 discs.
                          * If both discs are yours, you only get the bonus
                            **once**.
          - name: "Action: Journal (needs a 2nd disc)"
            text: |
              * Place a disc from your staging area onto a journal space in
                a zone where you have a sub. Spend the listed research cost
                on the matching journal cards and take it.
                  * The space's symbol **must match the symbol on the
                    journal card you take**.
              * The matching symbol has no bearing on what is activated on
                the card, all effects are activated regardless of the symbol.

              ## Journal Effects
              | Symbol | Benefit |
              | ------ | ------- |
              | ![points](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/points.png) | **Points**: Earn the displayed points at the end of the game. |
              | ![you](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/you.png) | **You**: You immediately gain all displayed benefits. |
              | ![others](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/others.png) | **Others**: These benefits are immediately gained by **all other players** (but not you). |
              | ![actions](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/actions.png) | **Actions**: For your turn, **instead of** placing a disc on a specialist, you can place a disc onto a journal action space. Discs on journal action spaces remain there for the rest of the game and may **not** be removed during reassignment. |
              | ![a_dive](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_dive.png) | Dive, and claim an additional dive token from that dive site (if any remain). |
              | ![a_travel](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_travel.png) | Travel, but treat your technology level as if it were 1 higher. That means you can move 1 extra zone and/or dive one depth deeper than usual. |
              | ![a_conserve](/static/img/endeavor_deep_sea/a_conserve.png) | Conserve at a conservation site where you have a sub at the same **depth**, even if you don't have a sub in the zone. |
          - name: Promotion
            text: |
              * When you receive a promotion effect, flip any junior specialist
                (blue side) to it's Senior side (gold).
              * You do not lose any attribute symbols that were on the
                junior side.
              * If there was a disc on the junior's circle when promoted,
                discard it back to your **supply**.
          - name: Special Zone Features
            text: |
              There are 3 basic types of special zone features.

              * **General Effects**: These will have a yellow warning triangle.
                These effects are not connected to any particular zone
                feature.
              * **Action Effects**: A yellow line leading away from a feature
                means that something special happens right after you
                activate that feature.
              * **Marked Spaces**: A yellow ring around a feature means that
                once you have a disc in that spot, the displayed special
                rule now applies to you.
          - name: The Impact Board
            text: |
              * Each scenario sheet has a different impact board layout.
                  * Some scenarios include special rules for how you
                    interact with the impact board.
              * When you gain impact, place a marker from your supply in an
                empty hex and gain any displayed reward.
                  * You may only place in a hex with an entry arrow pointing
                    to it, or in a hex that touches any other occupied hex.
              * Occupying hexes of certain colors will score you points at
                the end of the game (see the legend on the board).
              * A hex with a ∞ symbol can hold any number of tokens.
              * If you run out of markers, use a substitute.
          - name: End of the Round
            text: |
              * The round ends when all players have passed.
              * If it was the end of the 6th round, proceed to [final
                scoring](#scoring).
                  * You will know it's the 6th round because all players will
                    have 7 specialists, which includes their team leader.
              * Pass the wave token clockwise to set the new start player and
                begin the next round.
  - name: Final Scoring
    id: scoring
    text: |
      * Score points based on your position on all 4 tracks.  The point
        breakdowns are shown above different columns.
      * Score the points for your markers on colored hexes on the impact board.
      * Score points shown on some journals.
      * Score the points shown on each senior tier 5 specialist.
      * Score the points for mission goals.  Each scenario has goals printed on
        it and awards points.
          * Many goals offer leader bonuses as well.
              * If more than 1 player ties for 1st, they all earn 1st place
                bonus and no 2nd place bonus is awarded.
              * If a single player earns the 1st place bonus and there are
                multiple tied for the 2nd place bonus, all players tied for
                2nd receive the 2nd place bonus.
              * If you do not meet any of the goal's criteria, you cannot
                claim a leader bonus.
      * Add together your leftover research and discs in your staging area and
        divide by 3 (rounded down) and score this many points.

      The player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the tied players
      share the victory.
  - name: Co-op/Solo
    text: |
      All scenarios can be played in co-op or solo mode.  The only difference
      in the rules is that you play **7** rounds if playing solo.

      ## Additional Setup
      * Shuffle the setback cards and make a stack of 3 random setbacks face
        down (4 if playing solo).
      * Shuffle the bonus goal cards and place 3 random cards face down on
        top of the setbacks.
      * Choose the difficulty you wish to play at:
          * **Beginner**: Complete any 4 goals
          * **Intermediate**: Complete any 5 goals
          * **Expert**: Complete any 6 goals
          * **Legendary**: Complete all 7 goals

      ## Bonus Goals and Setbacks
      * At the start of each round (including the 1st), draw the top card of
        the stack.
          * Place bonus goals near the other goals on the scenario sheet.
          * Immediately apply the effect of any setbacks.

      ## How to Win
      * Play the game using the normal rules, but try to meet the thresholds
        for a set of goals.
          * Many co-op goals require you to reach a minimum amount of a
            particular criteria, determined by player count.  This does **not**
            mean that each player must individually meet that goal.  Instead,
            the team's **combined** amount must meet that goal.
      * At the end of the 6th round (7th if solo), assess your goals to see
        how many you achieved.
