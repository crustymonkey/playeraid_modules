                location as one or more opponents, <b>prior to activating
                any effects</b>, you may attempt to pickpocket. Choose an

                of that category, if able, or show you a hand containing
                none. Repeat this process for each opponent present at

                <p>If a timing conflict arises between the effects of locations
                and/or the abilities of one or more special assistants, the
                below order of operations should be followed to determine
                which takes priority:
                <ol><li>The Effect of a Location Tile<br/>
                <b>Example:</b> The effect of the Assistants Guild would allow
                an assistant to visit an occupied assistant space at the same
                location as the Snowman, including the Snowman’s space.</li>
                <li>The Ability of a Previously Placed Special Assistant<br/>
                <b>Example 1:</b> If the Goblin Sneak visits the same location
                as the Gelatinous Cube, the Gelatinous Cube’s ability triggers
                first, then the Goblin Sneak’s.<br/>
                <b>Example 2:</b> The Ghost cannot visit the same assistant
                space as the Snowman, because the Snowman’s ability takes
                precedence.</li></ol></p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> When a conflict arises between more than two
                special assistants, the assistant that has been at the
                location longest takes priority, then second longest, and so
                on.</p>
