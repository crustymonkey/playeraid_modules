      The game is played in continuous turns until someone gains the 3rd of the
      5 stars.  Play continues until everyone has had equal turns.

      * On your turn, you are going to place a worker at one of the locations
        and take it's action with the following rules:
        * If you place your worker on a space with another worker that worker
          is "kicked out".  The player who owns the kicked worker places
          it on any **open** kick out space for that location.  They may
          immediately gain the bonus of that kick out space.
        * If all your workers are on the board, take a worker already on the
          board and place it on a **different** space.
          * **You can never place your worker on the same location you just
            removed it from**, whether it's the action space or a kick out
            space.
          * **You can never place your worker on a location that already has
            one of your workers on it**, whether it's on the action space or
            a kick out space.
        * **If you are playing with the 2 player variant**:
          * You may leave an assistant on an **action space** (not a kick out
            space) that you are vacating with one of your workers.
            * This assistant can come from your supply or somewhere else on
              the board.
          * Similar to placing a worker on a space occupied by another worker,
            if there is an assistant, it is kicked out and placed on a kick
            out space similar to a worker.
          * **If you kick out your own assistant**, either remove it from the
            board or move it to the space you took that worker from.  It does
            **not** go to a kick out space.
          * You can have 1 of your workers and multiple assistants in the same
            location.
          * If a kick out occurs when no spaces are available, the player doing
            the kicking removes one of their assistants from a kick out space.
            If they don't have any of their assistants there, they choose an
            opponents assistant and return it to the player's supply.
            * Workers on kick out spaces **cannot** be replaced by assistants.
