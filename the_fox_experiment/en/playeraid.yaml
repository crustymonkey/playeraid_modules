      You will be trying to breed the friendliest foxes, completing the most
      studies, and attracting patrons.

      - name: "Phase 1: Selection"
        text: |
          * This consists of 3 rounds in turn order where each player selects
            **1** of the following items on their turn. Each player **must
            select 1 of each item across their 3 turns**, but they can
            be selected in any order.
              * 1 female fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * 1 male fox parent (from available or top of deck)
              * A supply track position. Note that you *can* use the 1st space
                of the track here, but it grants no supplies. It will assure
                that you are 1st in turn order though.
                  1. Immediately collect all supplies shown on the space (all
                     icons on the supply tile and any printed on the board).
                     See the table below for icons.
                  2. Discard the supply tile.
                  3. Place your gear token on the space you took the tile from.
                     *You will keep your current turn order token until
                     the administration phase*.

          | Icon | Description |
          | ---- | ----------- |
          | ![science](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/science.png) | Draw 1 science card from the top of the deck.  Keep it secret until you decide to use it. |
          | ![friendly](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/friendly.png) | Take 1 friendly token from the supply. |
          | ![trait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/traits.png) | Take 1 trait token of type shown from the supply. |
          | ![wtrait](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/wtrait.png) | Take 1 trait token of your choice from the supply. |

          ### Upgrades
          * Players are now able to unlock upgrades before moving on to the
            next phase.
              * In each of the 4 upgrade tracks, upgrades must be unlocked
                from left to right.
              * The circle to the right of the upgrade shows the cost (a
                number of trait tokens).  The diamond shows what is unlocked.
              * Upgrades can be unlocked any trait tokens, but they **must
                match**. e.g. If the cost is 2 tokens, you could use 2 tail
                tokens, but you could not use 1 tail token and 1 ear token.
                  * When upgrading place 1 of the tokens used to pay for it
                    on the circle, showing it is unlocked. Return the rest
                    to the supply.
                  * Upgrades cannot be partially unlocked.
              * You may unlock any number of spaces across any number of
                tracks (that you can afford).

          | ![studies](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/studies.png) | When you unlock a study upgrade, draw 3 new studies and keep 1, discarding the rest to the bottom of deck. |
          | ![fdice](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Each of these upgrades lets you roll 1 more friendly die each time you make a pup. When this is unlocked, take a friendly die and add it to your stash. |
          | ![patrons](/static/img/the_fox_experiment/fdice.png) | Choose 1 of the 4 patrons and place 1 of your fox meeples on the space next to them. Then gain the supplies on their supply tile + 1 science card. |
