          * Lay out the City board, Deed board, and Score board.  Be sure to
            use the correct side (smaller for 2-3 players, larger for 4-5).
          * Each player picks a color and takes the tray and cubes of their
            color.
          * Score cubes should be placed on their dedicated places on the
            Score board.
          * Pick a start player and give them the Start Player token.
              * The start player takes 5 coins and each other takes 1 more
                than the previous. e.g. the 4th player would take 8 coins.
          * Place the rest of the coins near the board.
          * If playing with less than 5 players, remove some cards:
              * **4 players**: Remove all the red deeds.
              * **3 players**: Remove all the red and purple deeds.
              * **2 players**: Remove all the red, purple, and blue deeds.
          * Shuffle the remaining deeds and deal 6 to each player.
              * **Optional draft variant**: You may draft deed cards instead
                of just using the randomly dealt cards. To do this (after
                the 6 cards have been dealt):
                  1. Each player selects a card from their hand and places it
                     face down.
                  2. After all players have selected a card, everyone
                     simultaneously reveals their cards and places a lot marker
                     on the corresponding location on the City board.
                  3. Each player passes the remaining cards to the person on
                     their left.
                  4. Repeat this until all cards have been drafted.
          * Each player places lot markers corresponding to their deeds.  Then,
            players keep the deed cards in a pile in front of themselves.
          * Split the remaining deed cards in approximately 3 equal piles and
            place them on the 3 eras on the Deed board.
          * Flip over the top 6 cards from Era 1.
          * **If playing with Monuments**:
              * Shuffle all the Monument cards together.
              * Turn over a number of Monuments equal to the number of players
                + 3 and place them near the City board.  Place the matching
                monuments on them.
              * Return the unused monuments and their cards to the box.

          Players do **1** of the following on their turn.

          * **Take Income**: Take 5 silver plus an amount of silver equal
            to the value of any commercial buildings you've built.
          * **Buy a Deed**:
              1. Pay the amount of silver shown above the deed and take the deed
                 card.
              2. Slide the other deeds from right to left fill in the open
                 space.
              3. Fill the last spot with the top card from the current era.
              4. Place one of your lot markers on the matching lot on the
                 city board.
              5. **If the last deed for the current era was purchased, do NOT
                 fill the deeds from the next era yet**.  Instead, proceed to
                 the [End of an Era](#end_era).
          * **Construct a Building**: Build a building from your player supply
            with the following rules:
              * You can build on empty lots you own without restriction.  If
                you are doing this, simply replace the lot markers with a
                building.
              * You can replace an already built building(s) **as long as the
                new building is larger in size**. If that would leave owned
                spaces open, be sure place lot markers in those owned lots.
                **You can never replace a building that is the same size or
                larger**.
              * **If you have constructed a residential building**, move your
                population marker up the the Population tracker equal to the
                amount of citizens on the building you built.
              * *If you are playing with Monuments*:
                  * If you meet the requirement (if any) for the Monument and
                    as well as the above conditions, you may build that
                    Monument.  Place a Monument marker of your color on
                    the newly built Monument.

          When all available deeds for the current Era have been purchased (not
          when the deck runs out), the Era ends.

          * When the deed board is empty, **each player takes one final turn
            to collect income or build**, including the player who purchased
            the last deed.
          * Pass the Start Player token to the player to the left of the
            1 who took the last turn in the previous Era.  They will begin the
            next Era.
          * Perform [end of Era scoring](#end_era_scoring).

                * **Residential Buildings**:
                    * Each player verifies the total number of citizens on
                      constructed buildings matches their position on the
                      Population tracker.
                    * All ties are friendly, so any tied players get the same
                      points/bonuses.
                    * The player with the most citizens scores victory points
                      equal to their position plus the era bonus:
                        * Era 1: 4 points
                        * Era 2: 7 points
                        * Era 3: 10 points
                    * Each other player scores a number of points equal to
                      the number of citizens the next player in front of them
                      has. **You must have at least 1 citizen to gain these
                      points!**
                * **Civic Buildings**:
                    * Players score victory points for symbols on adjacent
                      buildings. **Buildings are only adjacent if they share
                      an edge (orthogonal adjacency)**.
                * **Commercial Buildings**:
                    * Each player takes a number of silver equal to the value
                      of all their constructed buildings. **If it is the
                      final Era, players score victory points instead of
                      collecting silver**.
                    * Each player scores points for any buildings that show
                      a point value on their uncovered spot on their player
                      board.
                * **Monuments**: If playing with Monuments, take the listed
                  silver or points on the Monument card for the monument you
                  built.  These generally score the same as their regular
                  building type.
                * After all players have collected their silver and victory
                  points, refill the Deed board from the next Era and begin
                  the next Era.

          * **Reminder**: Commercial buildings should receive victory points
            instead of silver at the end of the 3rd Era.
          * Players score 1 victory point for each lot marker they have on
            the City board (marking empty, owned lots).
          * *If playing with [Trading and Stealing](#trading_stealing)*,
            add the points shown on any Favor tokens the player has.
          * *If playing with [Objectives](#objectives)*, add any points from
            completed objectives.
          * *If playing with [Invocations](#invocations)*, add any points on
            **unused** Invocation cards.

                This module is recommended for 4-5 players.  There are 3 ways
                to add the module to the game:  *Trading*, *Stealing*, or
                *Both*.

                * Regardless of which combo of mechanisms being used, each
                  player receives 2 Favor tokens at the start of the game.
                    * **The 4 VP side of the token is only used when using
                      *Stealing***. Only the 2 VP side should be used when just
                      playing with *Trading*.
                    * At the end of the game, players earn VP based on the
                      Favor tokens they have.
                * **Trading**: On your turn, you may trade empty lots you own
                  with any players that wish to trade with you. **Trading can
                  only involve the active player**.
                    * When trading, lots, silver, and favor tokens can be used
                      to make a trade. *If playing with
                      [Invocations](#invocations), players may use unused or
                      ongoing Invocation cards as part of a trade.
                    * Players may make promises as part of the trade, but
                      **promises are not binding and can be broken**.
                    * Trades can be done in addtion to taking your normal turn.
                    * **Building can NEVER be traded**.
                * **Stealing**: During your turn, you may forcefully take an
                  **empty** lot from another player.
                    * This, like Trading, is a free action that can be done
                      in addition to your normal action.
                    * **You can never seize a building, only an empty lot**.
                    * You must own **at least 2** lots and/or buildings
                      orthogonally adjacent to the lot you are stealing.
                    * You must have at least one 2 VP Favor token.  Flip this
                      to the 4 VP side and give it to the player you are
                      stealing from.
                    * Once stolen, take the Deed card and replace the lot
                      token with one of yours.
                    * **A Favor token on the 4 VP side is "spent" and may
                      not be used to steal**.
                        * If you are playing with Trading as well, the 4 VP
                          token can be used in a trade, but remains in its
                          "spent" state.

                This module allows for new ways to acquire VP.  It can be
                played 2 different ways: Hidden Objectives and Public
                Objectives. In either case, people that have met objectives
                score bonus points during the [end of game](#end_of_game)
                scoring.

                * **Hidden Objectives**: At the beginning of the game, each
                  player is dealt 2 objectives. Players choose one and removes
                  the other from the game.
                * **Public Objectives**: At the beginning of the game, lay out
                  a number of objectives face up equal to the number of
                  players. Multiple players can complete each objective.
                * Clarification: **Contiguous lots**.  If 2 or more lots share
                  an orthogonally adjacent edge, they are considered
                  contiguous.

                * **Setup**: After Deed cards have been dealt to players
                  and separated into 3 decks, but before flipping 6 face
                  up during setup, deal 9 Invocation cards face down at
                  random. Shuffle 3 Invocation cards into each Era deck.
                    * **IMPORTANT**: Some Invocation cards can only be used
                      with certain modules. Remove cards that do no match
                      modules you are using.
                * Invocation cards are treated like Deed cards and can be
                  purchased.  Once purchased, the player keeps it face down
                  until used.
                * Activating an Invocation card is a free action.
                * Unless otherwise specified, it can only be used on your turn.
                * After using an Invocation card, it is placed face up in your
                  Deed pile.
                * Some Invocation cards have ongoing abilities, keep these
                  separate and face up in your play area.
                * Some Invocation cards show a VP value. These points **are
                  only awarded if the Invocation card has NOT been used**.

                      1. Setup the game as usual.
                      2. Select an unused player color to use as the Consul on
                         the victory point and Population trackers.
                      3. Players and the Consul begin the game with 5 VP, but
                         still 0 VP.
                      4. Place the Consul card **PLANNING** side face up in
                         front of the 1st player.  That player will control
                         the Consul until the end of the Era.
                      5. Shuffle the size 1 Building tokens and create a face
                         down pile.  Do the same for other sizes.
                      6. Select a difficulty:
                          * **Standard**: The Consul starts with 0 Deed cards.
                          * **Hard**: The Consul starts with 2 random Deed
                            cards.  Place a Building token on each lot.  If
                            the lots are adjacent, place a size 2 token.
                          * **Challenge**: The Consul starts with 4 random Deed
                            cards.  Place a Building token on each associated
                            lot.  Make the largest building possible in case
                            of adjacency.
                          * If playing with the Monuments module, *Hard* or
                            *Challenge* difficulties are recommended.

                      * Players take turns as usual. After the start player
                        finishes their turn, the must flip the Consul card to
                        the **READY** side and do the following:
                          1. Take the leftmost Deed card. Place this in a
                             separate pile for the Consul.  Slide the cards down
                             and draw a new card as normal.
                          2. Construct a building token.
                              * If the new lot does not expand an area for
                                the Consul, take a random token from the
                                size 1 pile and place it in the new lot.
                              * If the new lot connects to one or more of the
                                Consul's existing buildings, place the largest
                                building tile possible on those lots.  Remove
                                the replaced tokens and place them in token
                                discards based on their size.
                                  * If this causes 1 or more lots to become
                                    empty, draw the largest token that can take
                                    that spot(s) and place it.
                              * If the face down token pile is empty, shuffle
                                the discards and add them face down.
                              * **If there are no more of the needed building
                                size, the Consul takes 7 VP instead**.
                          3. Flip the Consul card back to the **PLANNING** side.

                        normal for their population.  Instead the player with
                        the most Population (including the Consul) will get
                        the majority bonus. All other players receive a VP
                        *penalty* for the diff between their Population and
                        the player with the most.  The rest of the buildings
                        score as normal.
                      * **Consul's Commercial Buildings**: When the Consul
                        places Commercial buildings, it changes the
                        *minimum* price on the board.
                          * Every 2 silver on the Consuls buildings raises
                            the *minimum* price by +1 silver.  Place coins
                            on the Deed board to remind people of this.
                      * **End of an Era**: Pass the Consul card and control of
                        the Consul to the next clockwise player.
                      * **Winning and Losing**: After final scoring, the
                        players win if each player has a higher score than the
                        Consul.  If not, the Consul wins.
